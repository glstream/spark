Praise for The Functional Art
“Welcome to Alberto’s world. Cairo has done it all in The Functional Art: Theory, Practice,
Examples. And he’s done it brilliantly. It is the most comprehensive and sensible book
yet on real-world information graphics. We won’t need another one for a long time.”
—Nigel Holmes
“If graphic designer Nigel Holmes and data visualizer Edward Tufte had a child, his
name would be Alberto Cairo. In The Functional Art, accomplished graphics journalist
Cairo injects the chaotic world of infographics with a mature, thoughtful, and scientifically
grounded perspective that it sorely needs. With extraordinary grace and
clarity, Cairo seamlessly unites infographic form and function in a design philosophy
that should endure for generations.”
—Stephen Few, Author of Show Me the Numbers
“This book is long overdue. Whether you’re just getting started visualizing information
or have been doing it all your life, whether your topic is business, science, politics,
sports or even your personal finances, and whether you’re looking for a basic understanding
of visualization or a detailed how-to reference, this is the book you were
looking for. Alberto Cairo, a professional journalist, information designer and artist,
shows how to visualize anything in a simple, straightforward, and intelligent way.”
—Karl Gude, former infographics director at Newsweek and graphics editor in
residence at the School of Journalism, Michigan State University
“The Functional Art is brilliant, didactic, and entertaining. I own dozens of books on
visual information, but Cairo’s is already on the shortlist of five that I recommend to
anybody that wishes to have a career in information graphics, along with those by
Edward Tufte, Nigel Holmes, and Richard Saul Wurman. Cairo is one of those rare
professionals who have been able to combine real-world experience with the academia.”
—Mario Tascón, director of the Spanish consulting firm Prodigioso Volcán
“Using his enormous professional and academic experience, Alberto Cairo offers a
first-hand look at the revolution in visual communication. This book is key to understanding
the current situation of print and online information design.”
—Javier Zarracina, graphics director at The Boston Globe
“The Functional Art is the perfect starting point for a career in information graphics and
visualization, and also an excellent guide for those who already have some experience
in the area. This is the first real textbook on infographics.”
—Chiqui Esteban, director of new media narratives at lainformacion.com, and
blogger at InfographicsNews

Experience teaches you that the archetype of the self-made man is a myth with
roots in humankind’s relish for delusion. Life’s meanderings are determined
by chance and luck, and the only thing we can do to funnel those factors is to
ready ourselves to identify and seize opportunities when they pass by. We are
the product of effort as much as we are shaped by the people who surround us.
In this sense, I feel I am one of the luckiest individuals on Earth: I will start this
book saying that curiosity is the most important trait any communicator should
have. Therefore, I have to thank those who have ignited my curiosity throughout
the years and have helped me focus it.
This book is, first, for my parents. When I was a kid, my dad prompted me to love
books and good stories, both fictional and real, and to develop an insatiable hunger
for new knowledge. Inadvertently, he also revealed to me how to summarize and
convey information with images and how to be precise, concise, clear, and fun (or
so I hope) when teaching others. In addition to being a medical doctor, my father
is also an artist. He used to lecture on anatomy at a local university in Spain, and
one of his former students once told me that, many years after graduating, the
only classes he remembered from college were my father’s. He told me it was
because of the beautiful diagrams and cutaways Professor Cairo used to sketch
out on the blackboard while he talked.
From my mother, I treasure a most relevant lesson: Don’t give up pursuing and
defending what you have been able to prove to be true, no matter what.
Thanks to my editors, Nikki McDonald and Cathy Lane, at Peachpit Press. They
believed in this project from the very first day, and they encouraged me to keep
writing in times of fatigue.
To Luis G. Prado, my editor and publisher in Spain, Óscar Fernández, from El País,
and Ferrán Giménez and Laia Blasco, two colleagues at the Universitat Oberta de
Catalunya: Years ago, they prompted me to put what I knew about information
graphics and visualization into writing, and they aided me in making sense of it.
I wish to thank several students of mine. First, Patricia Borns, who read almost
the entirety of The Functional Art and gave me valuable advice on how to improve
its style. This book is much more readable because of her. Eileen Mignoni and
Sophia Dengo read and edited very preliminary chapters, years ago. I also got
suggestions from Lex Alexander, Mel Umbarger, and Lauren Flowers, and from
many other of my undergraduate and graduate students at the University of
North Carolina-Chapel Hill and at the University of Miami.
To Nigel Holmes, Stephen Few, and Karl Gude for their kind comments about
the content of The Functional Art: Coming from them, their words mean a lot to
me. They were three of my main sources when I was learning how to visually
display information. They are giants with broad shoulders; I’ve taken advantage
of that. Thanks also to Chiqui Esteban and Javier Zarracina, Spanish infographics
masterminds.
Many of the examples in The Functional Art come from my two years as director
of infographics and multimedia at Época magazine, in São Paulo, Brazil. I wish to
thank the wonderful people I had the honor to work with. First, the infographics
department: Marco Vergotti, David Michelsohn, Rodrigo Cunha, Rodrigo
Fortes, Gerson Mora, Luiz Salomão, Gerardo Rodríguez, Erik Scaranello, and
Pedro Schimidt. Also, Época’s art director, Marcos Marques, author of some of
the most impressive covers I’ve ever seen in a news magazine. Thanks also to
Helio Gurovitz and his deputy, David Cohen, two managers with a background
in computer science and engineering who understand what visualization and
data journalism are about.
To my colleagues at the University of Miami and at UNC-Chapel Hill: Rich Beckman,
Laura Ruel, Don Wittekind, Pat Davison, Charles Floyd, Kim Grinfeder, Michelle
Seelig, and Jim Virga. Also, to the deans who, since 2005, have supported me in the
teaching of graphics and visualization: Richard Cole, Tom Bowers, Jean Folkerts,
and Gregory Shepherd.
To the people who, every year, organize and participate in the Malofiej International
Infographics Summit (www.malofiej20.com): Javier Errea, Álvaro Gil, John
Grimwade, Geoff McGhee, Juan Velasco, and so many others.
To Mario Tascón and Gumersindo Lafuente, makers of www.elmundo.es, where I
was graphics director between 2000 and 2005. They both trusted a certain rookie
more than a decade ago.
To all my colleagues at La Voz de Galicia, Diario 16, El Mundo, DPI Comunicación,
and all the other newspapers and magazines I have worked for, both as a full-time
employee and as a consultant. I wish to also thank all the organizations, companies,
and friends who graciously gave me permission to use their infographics
and visualizations in this book.
Finally, The Functional Art is, above all, for my wife and kids. In the past several
months, they had to endure long hours of silence and deep concentration on my
part. Patience has never failed them. Writing is the most solitary activity I know.
I could not have survived without their support. I love you.
About the author
Alberto Cairo teaches information graphics and visualization at the University
of Miami’s School of Communication and serves as an advisor for the Master
of Arts in Technology and Communication program at the University of North
Carolina (UNC)-Chapel Hill.
In 2000, Cairo led the creation of the Interactive Infographics Department at

an invited lecturer and keynote speaker at all of the most influential international
conferences on visual journalism and design. He has taught in the U.S., Mexico,
El Salvador, Costa Rica, Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Spain,
Portugal, France, Switzerland, Ukraine, Singapore, and South Korea. He has also
been a consultant with many top news publications in those countries. Since 2006,
he has been a lecturer at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya, the first public
university in Spain to offer online accredited degrees.
About the DVD
The video course in the DVD that accompanies The Functional Art expands on
the contents of this book. The course is similar to the materials I’ve used in the
past in my classes at UNC-Chapel Hill and at the University of Miami so, in case
you are an instructor, they may be a good starting point to develop your own
presentation slides. If you are a professional or a student, please be aware that
many of the examples showcased in the video course are different than the ones
included in the book.
The DVD is divided into three video lessons: First, there is an introduction to basic
visualization concepts, followed by a discussion on the principles of graphic
design, and finally, a section on how to plan for infographics projects. 
In the first video lesson, I delve into the ideas outlined in the first section of The
Functional Art. You will learn, for instance, why infographics should be “functional
as hammers, multilayered as onions, and beautiful as equations.” I also discuss
what strategies you can follow to choose the most appropriate graphic forms to
display your information.
In the second lesson, I explain the main principles of graphic design, such as unity,
variety, and hierarchy, and how to apply them to create better layouts. I also give
you some basic tips on how to better use type and color.
In the third lesson, I discuss an impressive visualization made by the British
newspaper The Guardian. I also explain how I developed the chart on the front
cover of The Functional Art. You will see how I use Microsoft Excel and Adobe
Illustrator, and why I call my approach “low-tech visualization.” This lesson is
not a tutorial on software tools, but it may give you a clue or two about how to
start a career in information graphics. If you work in this field already, this video
may reveal a few tricks that you can apply in your own projects.

Introduction
Infographics and
Visualization
The remarkable mechanisms by which the senses understand the environment
are all but identical with the operations described by the psychology
of thinking.
—Rudolf Arnheim, from Visual Thinking
The partnership of presentation
and exploration
If you asked me to choose one mystery that has fascinated me through the years,
it would be our brain’s ability to create and understand visual representations
with different degrees of abstraction: graphics that encode data, concepts, connections,
and geographical locations. How is it possible that the brain, a wrinkled
chunk of meat and fat squeezed into a cavity too small for its size, can accomplish
such challenging tasks? This book is my personal attempt to answer that question.
The human brain has dozens of regions related to visual perception: densely interconnected
groups of neurons devoted to the processing and filtering of information
that we collect through our eyes. Evolution designed us such that no other
activity demands more mental resources than visual perception and cognition.
This fact permeates everything we do, and impacts the way we express ourselves.
Go ahead and explain a difficult concept to a friend. In the moment she gets what
you mean, she will exclaim, with a sparkle of relief and happiness in her eyes:
“I see!”
Her expression makes complete sense, because deep inside our minds, to see and
to understand are intertwined processes. We understand because we see. This
causal relationship is also true the other way around. As I will explain later, we
see because we have previous understanding of certain things. Seeing precedes
understanding, and this understanding precedes a better, deeper seeing down
the road.
We are a visual species. We are also a symbolic species, if we follow Terrence W.
Deacon’s famous definition.1
 Everything our senses gather is transformed, deep
inside our minds, into simple, manageable representations, or symbols. Some of
those symbols are verbal or textual, encoded with one of the thousands of languages
and dialects humanity has devised. They can also be expressed through
what Harvard psychologist Steven Pinker called mentalese, the inner language
the mind uses to talk to itself.2
1 Terence W. Deacon, The Symbolic Species: The Co-Evolution of Language and the Brain (New York:
W.W. Norton & Company, 1998).
2 Steven Pinker, The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language (New York: Harper Collins
Publishers, Inc., 1994). Pinker builds on Noam Chomsky’s hypothesis of an innate universal grammar.
introduction: infographics and visualization xv
But not all symbols are verbal. The brain doesn’t just process information that
comes though the eyes. It also creates mental visual images that allow us
to reason and plan actions that facilitate survival. Imagine a bus. Picture it
in your head. Now, examine it: Is it yellow, or blue, or red? Does it have a license
plate? Is it a plate of the state you live in? That’s it. That’s a mental image. Understanding
the mechanisms involved in these brain processes can help you become
a better communicator, visual or otherwise.
This is the first theme of the book you have in your hands.
The second theme is the common nature of infographics and information visualization.
Some professionals and academics have erected a sharp distinction
between the two disciplines. According to them, infographics present information
by means of statistical charts, maps, and diagrams, while information visualization
offers visual tools that an audience can use to explore and analyze data sets.
That is, where infographics tell stories designed by communicators, information
visualization helps readers discover stories by themselves.
In the following pages, I take an unorthodox approach. Infographics and visualization
exist on a continuum. Let me explain.
Imagine two straight, black parallel lines. On the top line, put the word “Infographics”
on the left tip and ‘”Visualization” on the right. On the line at the bottom,
write “presentation” on the left, and “exploration” on the right. All graphics
present data and allow a certain degree of exploration of those same data. Some
graphics are almost all presentation, so they allow just a limited amount of
exploration; hence we can say they are more infographics than visualization
(Figure 1), whereas others are mostly about letting readers play with what is
being shown (Figure 2), tilting more to the visualization side of our linear scale.
But every infographic and every visualization has a presentation and an exploration
component: they present, but they also facilitate the analysis of what they
show, to different degrees.
An excellent example: The beauty of Stefanie Posavec’s Literary Organism is based
on its organic appearance and careful selection of typefaces and colors, and also

on the multiple readings you can extract from it. Each subdivision of this treelike
graphic represents a deeper, more granular level of organization in the book:
chapters, paragraphs, sentences, and words. Colors correspond to the most common
themes of the novel: travel, music, parties, sex, and so on.
After spending some time fathoming it, patterns emerge and convey a different
message to each viewer. While the uninitiated in Kerouac’s oeuvre will identify
a big picture of the main topics the book discusses, the specialist or literary critic
will be able to use this work of art as a tool to test hypotheses and intuitions. Is
sex a prevalent theme in On the Road, for instance? What about the chapters that
combine paragraphs about sex with paragraphs about work and survival?
A chart of mine in Figure 3 also illustrates the complementarity between presenting
and exploring. Each point of the color line represents a year between 1981
and 2010 in the history of Brazil. The position of a point on the horizontal axis
is equivalent to the Gross Domestic Product, measured in billions of dollars. The
position on the vertical axis is equivalent to the inequality level measured with
the GINI index, developed by the UN. The farther to the right a point is, the bigger
the GDP (adjusted for inflation and for purchase power parity); the higher
the point is on the vertical scale, the higher the inequality in that particular year.
In other words, the graphic represents the covariation of economic development
and social justice. The headline summarizes its central message: When the GDP

When the Brazilian Economy Improves, Inequality Doesn’t Drop
The graphic below shows the correlation between Brazilian GDP (horizontal axis) and inequality (vertical axis)
between 1981 and 2010. The position of the points, each representing a year, depends on how high GDP and
inequality were. You can notice, for instance, that the economy grew between 1986 and 1989 because the
line tends to move to the right, but inequality also grew, as the point representing 1989 is much higher than
the ones before. You can also see that, during Lula da Silva’s government, the economy expanded almost as much
as during the terms of the other presidents who preceded him combined.

Each color on the line

Sources: World Bank, IMF, IBGE Graphic by Alberto Cairo
The 1980s are known as the “Lost Decade” in
Brazil for a reason: the GDP was stagnant and
inequality reached its highest point in 1989,
under José Sarney’s presidency. It was a time
of hyperinflation that aected mostly the
poorest, who didn’t have access to investments
and bank accounts. Fernando Collor’s and
Itamar Franco’s presidencies registered
modest GDP improvements, but inequality
varied widely: sometimes it dropped and the
next year, for no apparent reason, it increased
again. Only during Fernando Henrique
Cardoso’s (FHC) and Lula da Silva’s
governments does the curve tend to stabilize:
the economy starts growing at a steady pace
and inequality decreases with no interruption.

grows, inequality does not necessarily drop. It’s one of the disgraces of recent
Brazilian history that improvements in the economy don’t always lead to a better
living standard for everybody. In some years, particularly on the first half of the
line, the opposite is true.
When I finished designing this project, I showed it to some middle-aged colleagues
at Época, a weekly news magazine I worked for between 2010 and 2011. Their
response was unanimous and encouraging. Although they were writers rather
than designers or artists, all of them understood the graphic with a minimum of
introduction: infographics and visualization xix
effort. It confirmed for them facts that every Brazilian older than 40 remembers:
the constant and stable economic growth the country went through during Lula’s
administration (2003–2011), when the government promoted several income distribution
programs; the instability of José Sarney’s and Fernando Collor’s years,
when the GDP barely improved but inequality varied erratically; the stabilization
forced by Fernando Henrique Cardoso (FHC), who took Brazil out of the black
hole of inflation; and so on.
Some of them even told me that the multicolored line was history-making, because
it revealed the correlation between the two variables, which had never
been shown before. The line looks wildly erratic between 1981 and 1992 (the chaos
years); it smooths between 1993 and 2002 (the stabilization period); and it becomes
perfectly straight after 2003, revealing an almost perfect relationship between
better economic output and more equality in Brazil. To see self-proclaimed nonvisual
people in the process of unraveling such an uncommon graphic form, and
getting satisfactory messages from it, was eye-opening for me.
The surprise reaction of my “text” colleagues as they read the graphic, rather than
merely looked at it, has deep roots. This is the third theme of The Functional Art:
Graphics, charts, and maps aren’t just tools to be seen, but to be read and
scrutinized. The first goal of an infographic is not to be beautiful just for the
sake of eye appeal, but, above all, to be understandable first, and beautiful after
that; or to be beautiful thanks to its exquisite functionality.
If you are among those journalists, designers, and artists who think that infographics
and visualization consist of a bunch of data shaped into a spectacular
and innovative form, keep reading. I hope I will be able to make you forget that
simplistic idea. As Ben Shneiderman wrote once, “The purpose of visualization is
insight, not pictures.”3
 Images are the vocabulary of a language. They are means,
not ends. You will never hear a writing journalist say that her goal is to strive
for a good literary style by using elegant sentences and sophisticated structures.
Her style is just a tool to facilitate comprehension and to wake up emotions in
readers’ minds so they’ll absorb difficult ideas with ease. Aesthetics do matter,
but aesthetics without a solid backbone made of good content is just artifice.
3 Stuart Card, Jock Mackinlay and Ben Shneiderman, Readings in Information Visualization: Using
Vision to Think (London: Academic Press, 1999).
xx the functional art
In this book, you will see that I write quite a bit about visual journalism. That’s
because I am a journalist, and I am convinced that many of the challenges news
media face in using graphics are common to other professions that also use them
on a regular basis, such as marketing, advertising, business intelligence, data
analysis, and so on.
In newspapers and magazines, infographics have traditionally been created
within art departments. In all of those I’m familiar with, the infographics director
is subordinate to the art director, who is usually a graphic designer. This is
not a mistake per se, but it can lead to damaging misunderstandings. In Brazil,
the country where I lived while writing part of this book, journalists and designers
call graphics “art.” They would say, with that charming musicality of South
American Portuguese, “Vamos fazer uma arte!” (“Let’s make a piece of art!”)
Thinking of graphics as art leads many to put bells and whistles over substance
and to confound infographics with mere illustrations.
This error is at least in part the result of a centuries-long tradition in which visual
communication has not been as intellectually elevated as writing. For too many
traditional journalists, infographics are mere ornaments to make the page look
lighter and more attractive for audiences who grow more impatient with long-form
stories every day. Infographics are treated not as devices that expand the scope of
our perception and cognition, but as decoration. As Rudolf Arnheim wrote, this
tradition goes back to ancient Western philosophy, whose Greek thinkers such
as Parmenides and Plato mistrusted the senses deeply.4
 Unfortunately today, 40
years after Arnheim’s masterful Visual Thinking was published, the philosophy
is still in very good health.
The fourth theme of the book, therefore, is the relationship between visualization
and art, which is similar to the linkage of journalism and literature.
A journalist can borrow tools and techniques from literature, and be inspired
by great fiction writing, but she will never allow her stories to become literature.
That notion applies to visualization, which is, above all, a functional art.
Let’s get started.

Why Visualize: From
Information to Wisdom
My expertise has always been my ignorance, my admission and acceptance
of not knowing…. When you can admit that you don’t know, you are more
likely to ask the questions that will enable you to learn.
—Richard Saul Wurman, from Information Anxiety 2
Recently someone asked me what personality trait best characterizes those interested
in a career in visualization and infographics. My answer: “An insatiable,
childish curiosity.”
Curiosity, combined with a tendency to try to explain everything using reason,
led me to a career in journalism and, later, to specialize in information graphics.
It is not possible to be a good communicator if you have not developed a keen
interest in almost everything as well as an urge to learn as much as you can about
the strangest, most varied, unrelated topics. The life of a visual communicator
should be one of systematic and exciting intellectual chaos. In my case, it
consists of regular shifts between journalism, cognitive psychology, international 
politics, and history. In your case, it might be sports, music, architecture, or just
about anything else.
Let me give you an example of how far healthy curiosity can take you.
Rational Optimism
My original plan for this chapter was to open it with a few formal definitions for
information visualization, information design, and infographics. But something
changed my mind. While randomly navigating The New York Times website, I
stumbled on a review of a book called The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves,
by British science essayist Matt Ridley (2010).
The review1
 was mostly critical, but the hypotheses Ridley proposed sounded intriguing.
The book honored its title, making a case for optimism about our future
as a species. I had read other Ridley books in the past and had loved his Genome:
The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters (2006), so I was positively biased.
My curiosity ignited, I grabbed my Kindle and purchased the book. One minute
later, it had finished downloading. For the rest of the day, I traded book writing
for reading. (Note to my editor: I did it to make this chapter better, I promise!)
The book is so well written that it was difficult to put down before the end.
One chapter about the fertility rate, or the average number of children born to
women in each country, caught my eye. You may have heard or read the stories
of Malthusian doomsayers who claim that rising fertility in poor regions is the
reason the Earth has to support 7 billion people, with a forecast of 9 billion two
decades from now, and even more in the far future.
Other doomsayers focus on the aging populations of developed countries where
fertility rates are below 2.1 children per woman, a number that is known as the
“replacement rate.” If the replacement rate in a country is significantly below 2.1,
the population will shrink over time. If it’s much higher than 2.1, you’ll have a
much younger population down the road, which can cause problems. Younger
populations, for example, show greater rates of violence and crime.
Ridley contradicts both kinds of apocalyptic thinking by discussing two interesting
trends. On average, fertility in rich countries is very low, but in the past few
years it has trended slightly upward. On the other hand, poor countries show a
decrease in average fertility. Contrary to conventional wisdom, in many countries
1 William Easterly, “A High-Five for the Invisible Hand,” The New York Times, June 11, 2010.

that verge on becoming first-world economies, such as Brazil, the drop is dramatic:
the fertility rate has trended from more than six children per woman in
1950 to less than two in 2010.
Ridley suggests that, due to these two complementary trends, fertility rates everywhere
will converge around 2.1 in a few decades, and the world population
will stabilize at 9 billion people. It’s counterintuitive, isn’t it?
Ridley’s case is compelling and supported by prospective data from reliable
sources, such as the United Nations (UN) and The World Bank.2
 But something
made me uncomfortable as I read his arguments. It took me a while to figure out
what it was. Ridley writes about curves and lines and trends, but the chapter on
fertility and population includes just one graphic, similar to the one in Figure 1.1.

The graphic is simple and clear, but also insufficient to support the claims Ridley
makes. All it shows is that when you plot population change as a time-series chart,
the trend is negative. The closer we get to the present, the lower the worldwide
population growth. The fact that the graphic is an aggregate of the data of
all countries in the world impedes our ability to see the multiple patterns

Ridley discusses. Where are those rich countries whose fertility rate is slowly
recovering? Where is the evidence for the assertion that developing countries
such as Brazil, China, and India are stabilizing their populations?
I told you before that I am curious. I didn’t just take a day off to read The Rational
Optimist. I also looked for the data Ridley used for the chapter on population. With
that data, would I be able to prove his hypotheses?
Low-Tech Visualization to the Rescue
The first thing I did was go to the United Nations website. If you search for “UN
data,” you will quickly find http://data.un.org/, which is a kind of paradise if you
like to dig into huge databases on population, education, economics, and social
development. Within the UN site, I searched for the fertility rate data. The UN’s
figures begin in 1950; the projections extend as far as 2100.
I decided to exclude the years after 2010, playing with actual data (at that time)
rather than forecasts. Using the filters the site offers, I asked for a table that
included the more than 150 countries on which the UN has complete research.
Figure 1.2 shows a screenshot of what I obtained.
Figure 1.2 UN data table.
I downloaded the table and decided to try a low-tech visualization exercise to
show my students—mostly journalists with no technology background—that
learning to create information graphics is not all that difficult.

Using OpenOffice (an open source software suite that includes a spreadsheet
program), I reorganized the data and cleaned up the table a little. Some cells were
missing, so the process involved a bit of manual tweaking—no big deal. Figure 1.3
shows an excerpt of the result.
Figure 1.3 My UN data table after tweaking.
Still with me? Now the fun begins. We have the table in the computer. Is it possible
to make sense of it? Hardly. Extracting meaning from a table is tough. Can you
see any interesting trends just by reading the figures? If you can, congratulations.
You have an extraordinary memory. Most of us mortals have brains that didn’t
evolve to deal with large amounts of data. Let me prove it to you: Look at Figure
1.3 again and tell me in what years between 1950 and 1975 did the difference between
the fertility rates of Spain and Sweden grow, and in what years did it drop?
This apparently simple task forces you to do something extremely difficult: look
up a number, memorize it, read another one, memorize it and compare it with the
previous one, and so forth until you get to the end of the series. I wouldn’t bother.
But what if I designed a simple chart with the data in the spreadsheet? The result
(Figure 1.4) is a visual tool that helps answer my question. The message in
that graphic is clear: Spain started 1950 with an average number of children per
woman higher than Sweden’s. But then fertility in Spain fell drastically after 1970
and only recovered partially in the last five years of the series. On the other hand,
Sweden’s fertility rate has remained pretty stable over the last 60 years, although
it is well below the replacement level of 2.1 children per woman.
By giving numbers a proper shape, by visually encoding them, the graphic has
saved you time and energy that you would otherwise waste if you had to use a
table that was not designed to aid your mind. The first and main goal of any

 graphic and visualization is to be a tool for your eyes and brain to perceive
what lies beyond their natural reach.3
However, presenting data for two countries is far simpler than presenting data
for one hundred of them, which is what we may need to do in order to put some
of Matt Ridley’s ideas to the test. Once we represent the lines for all countries in
our data set, we get something similar to Figure 1.5. This colorful spaghetti dish
may look interesting, but it’s totally useless for our purposes. This is what you
get when you let a software program do the hard work for you.
Remember, what we want to reveal is the projected confluence of the lines of
rich countries (trending slightly up in recent years) and those of poor countries
(trending down) around the 2.1 children per woman line. If you look at Figure 1.5
long enough, you may be able to tell the lines apart, but it’s more likely you will
just give up.
The way to solve this problem is to add some visual hierarchy to the mix. Obviously
it makes no sense for all lines to be equally visible. In information graphics,
what you show can be as important as what you hide. I put the chart generated
in OpenOffice into Adobe Illustrator, where I highlighted a few rich countries
and a few developing and poor countries.
I made other countries’ lines light gray, so they remain on the scene but don’t
obscure the message. Why not get rid of them? Because they provide context to

Cleveland, Stephen Few, and Stephen Kosslyn, among others. See the Bibliography for references.

the cases that I highlight. While changing all the background lines to one color
makes it impossible to see them as independent entities, collectively they show an
overall downward trend in the data—you can see that many lines begin between
the 6.0 and 8.0 children per woman point in 1950, but just a handful of them remain
at that height in the vertical axis when they reach 2010. The final sketch in
Figure 1.6 looks much more user-friendly than the previous one.
Excited by what I was revealing, I explored other assertions made in The Rational
Optimist. Ridley argues that a sudden drop in a country’s fertility rate is usually
precipitated by several factors: an increase in average per capita income, women
getting better access to education, and the shrinking of infant mortality figures.
The facts that more children survive their first years of life and that women are
spending more time in school are positively correlated to better family planning.
On the economic side, Ridley explains that in rich countries, leisure options are
everywhere, and they are cheap and accessible; the distractions of the modern
world free us, albeit partially, of our primary impulse to reproduce with no control.
We can explain this phenomenon in bogus academic jargon: the average number

of children per couple is inversely proportional to the average amount of hours
each member of that couple spends in front of any kind of screen. No kidding.
To prove the correlation between fertility, income, and women’s schooling, I
designed two small scatter-plots in the same spreadsheet software I used before.
In Figure 1.7, each little circle represents a country. The position of each country
on the horizontal axis is proportional to its fertility rate. The position on the
vertical axis equals average income per person (first chart) and the percentage
of students in middle school who are female (second chart).

Figure 1.7 The more educated and rich you are, the fewer children you’ll have.
The black line running between the dots is called a trend line or regression line:
the closer the dots are to this line, the stronger the correlation between the two
variables represented. You can see that the dots are pretty close to the line, so the
variables are related. On average, the richer people are, the fewer children they
tend to have; and the fewer girls who attend middle school, the more children
on average they have in that particular country.
Here’s the lesson I learned from this exercise: In just three or four hours of work,
I completed a personal project that allowed me to see the evidence supporting
Matt Ridley’s discussion on the evolution of fertility. His hypotheses seem to have
some basis after all. But if you don’t present your data to readers so they can
see it, read it, explore it, and analyze it, why would they trust you? This is a
question many journalists, particularly those who write opinion columns, should
ask themselves more often.

Drowning in Data? Only If You Don’t Know How to Swim
The example I just gave you was not chosen randomly. It helps us delve into topics
that are essential to understanding the present state of graphics as a form of
communication. Isn’t it amazing that we can read graphics at all, and use them
to discover realities otherwise invisible to the bare eye? In the past two or three
decades, psychology has unveiled many of the brain mechanisms involved in this
kind of understanding. Another thought: Did you notice that the data I manipulated
is available on the Internet for free? And isn’t it wonderful that the tools I
used to prove Matt Ridley’s assertions are also broadly available to anyone and
can be learned in a matter of hours?
Those three trends have converged to put visualization in the mainstream. The
design of graphics is not just more democratic than it was a decade ago, when
data was sparse and software expensive and difficult to use. We also have the
potential to use graphics more intelligently because the principles informing
their design have never been clearer.
Embracing graphics and visualization is no trivial endeavor. Citing research by
International Data Corp (IDC), The Economist reported that the information generated
in 2010 alone reached 1,200 exabytes,4
 an amount equivalent to thousands of
billions of issues of the venerable British magazine. The story added that the total
amount of extant digital information totals several zettabytes. Here’s a simple
explanation to help you grasp the challenge we’re dealing with:
1 bit, or binary digit, is the basic unit of information in computing. It represents
either 0 or 1.
1 byte (the amount of information necessary to encode a letter or a number)
= 8 bits
1 kilobyte = 1,000 bytes
1 megabyte = 1,000 kilobytes or 1,000,000 bytes (106
)
1 gigabyte = 1,000 megabytes or 1,000,000,000 bytes (109
)
1 terabyte = 1,000 gigabytes or 1,000,000,000,000 bytes (1012)
1 petabyte = 1,000 terabytes or 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1015)
1 exabyte = 1,000 petabytes or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1018)
1 zettabyte = 1,000 exabytes or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1021)
1 yottabyte = 1,000 zettabytes or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes
(1024)
4 “All too much: monstrous amounts of data.” The Economist, Feb. 25, 2010.
14 the functional art
Confused? Don’t worry. You’re not alone. A yottabyte of information is such a huge
number that it is impossible to imagine. In August 2010, Erich Schmidt, former
CEO of Google, announced in a conference that between the beginning of time
and 2003, humanity generated roughly five exabytes of data, whereas we now
produce the same volume of bits every two days.
“The information explosion is so profoundly larger than anyone ever thought,”
said Schmidt. Five exabytes is more than 200,000 years of DVD-quality video.5
To be fair, not all that “information” is what you would call information in a colloquial
conversation. Most of it is the product of automated processes and communications
between computers, mobile phones, and other devices—nothing
that a human brain can understand. But still.
Let’s catch our breath here and move on.
From Information to Wisdom
In the 1970s, years before access to the Internet was universal, Richard Saul
Wurman, then a professor of architecture in North Carolina, predicted that the
oncoming information explosion would require the intervention of a new breed
of professionals trained in organizing data and making sense of it. According to
Wurman, the biggest challenge our species was about to face was to learn how to
navigate the upcoming tsunami of bits that was cresting the horizon.
Wurman called these people information architects. Their discipline, information
architecture, has been defined by others as:
• The structural design of shared information environments;
• The combination of organization, labeling, search, and navigation systems
within websites and intranets;
• The art and science of shaping information products and experiences to
support usability and findability;
• An emerging discipline and community of practice focused on bringing
principles of design and architecture to the digital landscape.
Wurman suggests that one of the main goals of information architecture is to help
users avoid information anxiety, the “black hole between data and knowledge.”
People still have anxiety about how to assimilate a body of knowledge that
is expanding by the nanosecond…. Information anxiety is produced by the
5 Google Atmosphere 2010 conference.

ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we
should understand.6
The gap is better represented through the diagram in Figure 1.8, which shows
the steps separating the two extremes of Wurman’s maxim. It is based on several
models known as DIKW Hierarchies (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom).
Although the models have been criticized as simplistic and vague,7
 they are useful
for explaining what visualizations and graphics are about.

In the diagram, unstructured information means reality, the world out there
in all its glorious complexity. Every phenomenon that can be perceived or measured
can be described as information.
Data are records of observations. Data can be encoded as symbols (numbers and
words) that describe and represent reality. In between unstructured information
and data, you can see a first level of encoding. Imagine a researcher studying the
fertility rate. The data would be the records the researcher makes in a spreadsheet,
for instance: 2, 5, 6, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3 (and so on) children per woman.
The second level of encoding takes us from data to structured information.
This happens when a communicator (a researcher, a journalist, or whomever)
represents data in a meaningful way, using text, visuals, or other means. We
can also say that this communicator has given shape to data, so that relevant
patterns become visible.

Business Review, February 2010.
16 the functional art
Information consumption can lead to higher knowledge on the part of the audience,
if its members are able to perceive the patterns or meaning of data. It is
not a passive process; our brains are not hard drives that store stuff uncritically.
When people see, read, or listen, they assimilate content by relating it to their
memories and experiences.
We reach wisdom when we achieve a deep understanding of acquired knowledge,
when we not only “get it,” but when new information blends with prior
experience so completely that it makes us better at knowing what to do in other
situations, even if they are only loosely related to the information from which
our original knowledge came. Just as not all the information we absorb leads to
knowledge, not all of the knowledge we acquire leads to wisdom.
Every step in our diagram implies higher order. When we see the world, we
unconsciously impose organization on the unstructured information that our
eyes gather and transmit to the brain. We create hierarchies. We don’t perceive
everything in front of us at once, as we’ll see later in this book. A moving entity,
for instance, attracts our attention more than a static one, because movement may
suggest an approaching threat. We therefore process the position and identity
of the moving object before paying attention to anything else. Our brain gives
meaning to the object, even if we are not aware of the reason why.
In the words of Kevin Kelly, a famous philosopher of technology, in his book What
Technology Wants (2010):
Minds are highly evolved ways of structuring the bits of information that
form reality. That is what we mean when we say a mind understands; it
generates order.
So, without conscious effort, the brain always tries to close the distance between
observed phenomena and knowledge or wisdom that can help us survive. This is
what cognition means. The role of an information architect is to anticipate this
process and generate order before people’s brains try to do it on their own.
Making Reality Visible
Today, information architect refers broadly to professions with very different sets
of tools and theoretical traditions. Outside academic circles, an information architect
can be someone who writes technical handbooks, a software engineer, a
web developer, a wayfinding designer (yes, that’s a profession; who do you think
creates public spaces that can be navigated with ease?), and that nerdy guy who
makes charts on fertility just for the fun of it.
1 · why visualize: from information to wisdom 17
All of those professions share the goal of making the world easier for audiences
and users, but that’s too broad a goal to put them all in the same bag. For my purposes
in this book, information graphics and visualization is a form of information
architecture. But how can we be more precise in describing the relationship
between the branch and the trunk?
Look at Figure 1.9 and imagine information architecture as a big circle. Inside
is the set of disciplines devoted to dealing with information. Among the most
relevant disciplines is information design, defined by Stanford University’s Robert
E. Horn as “the art and science of preparing information so that it can be used
by human beings with efficiency and effectiveness.”8
 The goal of the information
designer is to prepare documents (both analog and digital) and spaces so they
can be navigated effortlessly.

A significant part of information design is information graphics and visualization.
Academic literature sometimes separates infographics from visualization and
defines the latter as “the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations
of data to amplify cognition,”9
 but I prefer the more straightforward
take of Joan Costa, a famous Spanish professor of design: To visualize is “to make
certain phenomena and portions of reality visible and understandable; many of
these phenomena are not naturally accessible to the bare eye, and many of them
are not even of visual nature.”10

Estética 26, 1998). One of the best books I’ve read on the visual representation of information. No

Why does Costa add that second part about not being necessarily of visual nature?
Because graphical displays can be either figurative or non-figurative. To
understand figurative displays, think of a map as a scaled portrait of a geographical
area, or a manual that explains through illustrations how to use your new
washing machine, or a news infographic on a catastrophic plane crash, like the
one in Figure 1.10 (pages 20 and 21), a superb project by Público, a medium-sized
Spanish newspaper with a small but extremely talented graphics desk.
Other graphics that display abstract phenomena are non-figurative. In these,
there is no mimetic correspondence between what is being represented and its
representation. The relationship between those two entities is conventional, not
natural (see Figure 1.11). The unemployment rate doesn’t really resemble a grid
of multicolored rectangles, does it?

Visualization as a Technology
Let me introduce an idea crucial to the premise of this book: Visualization should
be seen as a technology. That may sound odd. When someone mentions technology
in a routine conversation, we usually think of machines: MP3 players, cars,
refrigerators, electric toothbrushes, lawn mowers, computers. But what do all
those devices have in common? I don’t mean physically, but in their very essence:

1. They are extensions of ourselves. Canadian media thinker Marshall
McLuhan was the first to advance this notion half a century ago. A lawn
mower helps us keep our garden neat without having to use our bare hands.
An electric toothbrush reaches small spaces in between our teeth that would
be impossible to reach with a toothpick—which is also a technology, by
the way. An MP3 player is not just a player, but also a device that helps us
remember the songs that define the best and worst moments of our lives.
2. They are means to reach goals. Sometimes it’s just one goal—a freezer
keeps food fresh—but it can be several. Think of a computer, whose functionality
depends on other technologies such as software that we install.
Technologies can harbor other technologies.
Visualization as technology has these same traits. Also, the word technology has
various meanings and is potentially open to interpretation. I use it here with
the sense given by W. Brian Arthur in his foundational The Nature of Technology
(2009). According to Arthur, we can use the word technology in three different
senses, illustrated in Figure 1.12: Technologies-singular, technologies-plural,
and technology-general.
Technology-general Technologies-plural Technologies-singular
Figure 1.12 The three kinds of technology: general, plural, and singular.
What Arthur means is that technology can be, first, any object, process, or method
devised to aid in a task, “a means to fulfill a human purpose.” This can be called
technology-singular. The refrigerator and other devices described above are examples.
The algorithms that run a software program as well as the letters, sentences, and
22 the functional art
paragraphs that help me communicate with you are also technologies-singular.
Even a humble nail is a technology.
Technologies-plural describe “assemblages of practices and components.” In other
words, they are groups of technology-singular items that, when put together,
make something new emerge. Electronics, biochemistry, and the varieties of
engineering are all technologies-plural. Arthur also refers to technology-plural
groups as “bodies of technology.”
The third meaning of technology is “the entire collection of devices and engineering
practices available to a culture,” or technology-general.
How is this relevant for information graphics and visualization? First, as emerging
disciplines, they are still a formative hodge-podges of concepts, methods,
and procedures borrowed from many areas: the principles of map design (from
cartography); guidelines on how to better display data on a chart (from statistics);
rules on best practices for the use of type, layout, and color palettes (from graphic
design); principles of writing style (from journalism); and more, including a wide
array of software tools.
Second, and more important, individual information graphics are also technologies,
means to fulfill purposes, devices whose aim is to help an audience
complete certain tasks. This apparent no-brainer will have consequences later on.
If you accept that a visualization is, above all, a tool, you are implicitly accepting
that the discipline it belongs to is not just art, but functional art, something that
achieves beauty not through the subjective, freely wandering self-expression
of the painter or sculptor, but through the careful and restrained tinkering of
the engineer.

John Grimwade
(Condé Nast Traveler magazine)
The Infographics Gentleman
John Grimwade is graphics director of Condé Nast Traveler magazine
(based in New York) and has his own information graphics business (www.
johngrimwade.com). He has produced infographics for more than 30 major
magazines and several books. Before moving to the United States, he
worked for 14 years in newspapers in London (including six years as head
of graphics at The Times). He co-hosts the annual Malofiej “Show Don’t Tell”
infographics workshop in Pamplona, Spain, and teaches information graphics
at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.
The first time I crossed paths with John Grimwade’s work was when I was about
to finish my B.A. in Journalism, in the summer of 1997. I had been offered an internship
in the information graphics desk of La Voz de Galicia, the biggest regional
newspaper in northwestern Spain. As my knowledge of the discipline was minimal,
Manuela Mariño and Xoan González (father of Xaquín G.V. [González Veira], who
you will meet in Profile 3), who led the department at the time, recommended
that I take a look at some Malofiej publications. Malofiej1
 is the International

Infographics Summit, organized every year by the Spanish chapter of the Society
for News Design. The event includes the most important competition in this field,
which receives submissions from newspapers and magazines from all over the
world. The winners are showcased in a series of large-format books.
While browsing several of these books, one graphic caught my eye. It was titled
“The Transatlantic Superhighway,” and it explained the busy flow of flights over
the Northern Atlantic (Figure 10.1). I was enthralled by its elegance and deceptive
simplicity. My colleagues told me that the piece—which had won a Silver
Medal at Malofiej—had been designed by a certain British maestro named John
Grimwade. “Along with Nigel Holmes, Grimwade is the best in this business,”
they added with a tone of reverence.
Years later, John and I became friends. He is a true gentleman, one of those professionals
who are always willing to help rookies (as I was when I met him) with
inexhaustible patience. He has also been a constant source of inspiration for me
and for many others in this industry. In the current era of big data, complex programming,
and information overload, his visual style—stripped down, precise, and
graceful—is a reminder that good design is not about mastering technology, but
about facilitating clear communication and the understanding of relevant issues.
Q Is it true that the way you produce graphics has not changed much in
the 40 years that you have worked as an information graphics designer?
John Grimwade It is. I started doing information graphics many years before
computers entered newsrooms. When they did, many colleagues said it was a
huge change, but not for me. Maybe our methods of work have shifted a bit but
the core principles are exactly the same.
Q What are those core principles?
JG Our main goal should be to tell a story clearly by achieving order and having
some sort of narrative through each graphic. Any project should start by analyzing
what your story is about and then finding the best way to tell it by splitting
it up into easily digestible chunks, without losing depth.
When I design a graphic, I try to establish a hierarchy, too. In the planning
stage, one of the first things I do is to identify the main components of the story
and define how they are going to be sequenced on the page or on screen.

Figure 10.1 “The Transatlantic
Superhighway.” Condé
Nast Traveler, 1996, by John
Grimwade, who explains
the graphics: “This is an
explanation of the system
that controls flights over
the Northern Atlantic. A
reporter had a map of airtraffic
control [see Figure
10.2], but it was difficult to
read. I wanted to understand
the system more thoroughly,
so I made contact with the
head of Oceanic Control
in Gander, Newfoundland.
Amazingly, there were no
visualizations available of the
system as a dimensional diagram.
So I thought, why not
make one? Rough versions
went back and forth until we
were both happy with the
graphic.”

Q That sounds like Journalism 101 to me. When you write a story, the best
thing to start with is a structure for your writing.
JG That’s because it is! The only difference between a traditional journalist and
us is the language. Journalists use words; we use pictures, charts, graphs, maps,
diagrams, and illustrations.
I think one of the reasons why some people of my generation were very
successful is because we were designers, but we got embedded in journalistic
environments. We worked with reporters and editors. That taught us that we
should strive for clarity because we are an interface between a chaotic world of
information and the user who wants to understand something. If we can’t bring
users clarity, I think we have kind of failed, actually.
When I see a graphic I am interested in, I try to read it critically, and one question
I ask over and over again is “What’s the point? What’s the story?” That’s what
you have to do when you work on a project. It’s not enough to do good research
Figure 10.2 One of the source materials for the “The Transatlantic Superhighway.”
An air-traffic control map.
216 the functional art
Figure 10.3 One of the sketches for “The Transatlantic Superhighway” infographic, shown in Figure 10.1.
and then present your information to your readers. You have to edit that information.
We, infographics designers, must work as reporters but, above all, as editors.
Q Is that why you have expressed reservations about the emerging field
of data visualization? Many infographics designers in newspapers and
magazines seem to be embracing it with enthusiasm, but you have said that
sometimes it feels that visualization designers seem to just throw data at
their users, without worrying about presenting coherent stories.
JG Embracing a new technique or a new technology is great. Data visualization
can be really powerful and useful. I can see a lot of potential in it. Nonetheless, I
also feel that many visualization designers try to transform the user into an editor.
They create these amazing interactive tools with tons of bubbles, lines, bars, filters,
and scrubber bars, and expect readers to figure the story out by themselves, and
draw conclusions from the data. That’s not an approach to information graphics
I like. Not all readers are data analysts!
Profile 1 · the infographics gentleman 217
Maybe I am old-school, but I don’t believe I am alone in that concern. Think of
Hans Rosling2
 and the way he interacts with his wonderful bubble visualizations.
He doesn’t just show stuff; he explains the main points, focusing the reader’s
attention on the most interesting parts of the information. After that, if readers
want to navigate deeper into other possible stories, they can do it. But first, they
are exposed to a traditional, linear narrative that lays out the basic facts.
Q Is it possible to find a synthesis between what information graphics
designers have been doing for the past 30 or 40 years and what data visualizers
are trying to achieve nowadays?
JG I am convinced that we will see that in the future. The New York Times3
 is
exploring that path at this point. For instance, in many of their interactive
graphics, they present complex sets of data, and they let you go really deep into
the figures and their connections. But beforehand, they give you some context,
some pointers as to what you can do with those data. If you don’t do this, if you
don’t include this layer of information, which the designers call the “annotation
layer,” you will end up with a visualization that may look really beautiful and
intricate, but that will leave readers wondering, “What has this thing really told
me? What is this useful for?”
It’s like a visualization I saw the other day that plotted the flow of taxis in
New York City, as well as their positions at every time of the day and night. It
looked really cool but, after a minute, I asked myself: What is this about? What
am I supposed to see here? Is it really that surprising that the flow of taxis is really
heavy between La Guardia and JFK, or that there are fewer taxis during the
night than during the day? That’s not a very revealing insight, is it?
Or take some gorgeous recent maps that show people tweeting all over Europe
in the languages of the countries they live in. All right, that’s really interesting
[said tongue-in-cheek]: The Germans are tweeting in German! The map certainly
looks beautiful with all those little color dots shining here and there, but it’s not
that enlightening. It doesn’t convey much, and that’s a problem. You need to orient
readers into the story before they can navigate your graphics on their own.
Q Let’s talk a bit about your own design process. How do you get started?
JG When we do a story for Condé Nast Traveler magazine, I try to be involved
in it as early as possible. Sometimes it happens that reporters don’t realize they

3 See Profile 3: Steve Duenes and Xaquín G.V.

will need infographics in their pieces until they get back from trips, so I prefer
to meet with them before they depart. It helps me get a clear idea of what shape
the story is going to take, of its focus, and it helps reporters understand how the
copy and the visual elements on the pages are going to complement each other.
I bring paper and pencils to those meetings. While we talk, I keep scribbling.
I do very rough sketches and take notes about the key elements. It’s in these meetings
when I decide what we need to show with the graphic so its content doesn’t
overlap too much with what the copy will tell or the photographs will show.
Q It seems that you put a lot of work in the planning stage of your projects,
judging by the detailed sketches and roughs you produce. (See Figure 10.3
and Figure 10.5.)
JG They are part of my thinking process. After the preliminary meetings are
over, I go to my studio and work out the structure of the graphic in a rough form.
I find that in pencil I can just do a rough version, arrange the elements as I wish,
and throw away whatever I feel is not related to the points I want to get across.
There’s virtually nothing invested in those sketches.
If you try to do something like that in a computer, you will somehow feel
committed to your first ideas. Sketching out using design software requires a lot
of effort. Later, when you go over your plans with editors, everything may need
to change for some reason, maybe because the focus of the story has switched.
If you are enamored with your own computer graphics, those that took so much
time to develop, you may feel resistant to change them down the road.
In other words: at first, don’t just draw a box in Adobe Illustrator and start
working inside it. That’s a very bad way to start: You make a lot of art decisions
and then trap yourself into them. I constantly see graphics that have been done
like that. A big image or illustration was put in the middle first and then the
designer tried to make all the other elements in the composition work around
it, instead of coming up with a solid structure that would help tell the story you
need to tell. This doesn’t happen when you work with pen and paper before you
proceed to the artwork phase.
I try to encourage my students at the School of Visual Arts to draw as many
sketches as possible, due to this attachment factor that everybody experiences
every now and then. Sometimes they feel intimidated by hand drawing, but I tell
them that they don’t need to be Leonardo da Vinci. What they need to come up
with is not art; they don’t need to worry about aesthetics at this point, but about
the structure. In many cases, just a bunch of very simple, rough, and badly drawn
sketches made with cheap pencils or crayons will suffice to help you understand

ore than just a gateway
to a great city, Grand
Central Terminal has
been reborn as a destination
in its own right,
replete with upscale shopping, restaurants,
and, soon, even a green market.
Don’t let the commuter crush deter you:
Begin your tour at the entrance on
42nd Street at Park Avenue, checking
your train time on the 13-foot-tall, giltedged
clock beneath Coutan’s sculpture
group Transportation. Proceed down the
entrance ramp, whose tilt is designed to
propel you, heart pounding, to the
Main Waiting Room, temporarily home to
vendors of every stripe but soon to host
functions and public exhibitions. Directly
ahead, over a short bridge with freshly
quarried balustrades, lies the terminal’s
pièce de résistance, the Main Concourse—dubbed
“the best big room in
America” by the architectural press. Its
ceiling, at 122 feet, is higher than the nave
of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. At the
center of the concourse sits the information
booth with its four-sided brass
clock, kept perpetually in sync with the
atomic clock at the U.S. Naval Observatory
in Washington, D.C. Overhead is
the 2,500-star Sky Ceiling, whose autumn-night
constellations were originally
painted backward and never corrected.
Daylight brightens the concourse from
four-story windows at either end.
Concealed between the windows’ inner
and outer panes is a series of skywalks, or
glass-floored corridors, designed to access
a skyscraper that was never built; tours
sponsored by the Grand Central Partnership
permit access (212-818-1777). Head
for the Lower Concourse via the newly
excavated Oyster Bar ramps, open for
the first time since 1927 and illuminated
by five gold-and-nickel-plated chandeliers,
with 144 lightbulbs each (an
identical set graces the terminal’s north
balcony). Pause here for a new view of
the Sky Ceiling through the concourse’s
massive piers. At the base of the ramps,
the vaulted tile ceiling allows you to
face the wall in any corner and whisper
to someone standing in the opposite corner.
Reward your exertions at the
Oyster Bar restaurant, whose classic oyster
stews and pan roasts are themselves
deserving of landmark status—or at
one of some 20 new restaurants on the
Lower Concourse. Return to the Main
Concourse level via the West Staircase.

restoration. At the time, I was walking through the building every day on my way to work, so
the reference was right in front of me. I used the simple approach of taking a cross-section

how to organize a story, how to create a good sequence of steps, and a good hierarchy
in your layout.
Q Speaking of students, you are well known for your openness to give advice
to beginners and help them develop their own styles. What would you
recommend to someone who is planning to pursue a career in information
graphics and visualization? What should that person study?
JG That’s very difficult question. I guess the challenge is that you are asking me
to think backward. I learned to design infographics by working in a newsroom.
Decades ago, I landed in a news publication and learned the craft on the job.
I would say, however, that the first skill you need to master is to look at
graphics with a critical eye. Read newspapers, magazines, and textbooks; visit
websites that showcase infographics and visualizations; and analyze if they help
you understand important matters. If they don’t, they are not good. The next thing
would be to reflect on the changes that would make those presentations tell clearer
messages. And, if you have the time, you can maybe even make those changes.
You also have to ponder if you have the passion to enter this field. Infographics
is not the easiest task. It might look like it is but it sure as hell isn’t. You need
years of self-teaching and trial-and-error to master the techniques and tools. If
you don’t feel the drive to be absolutely meticulous about research and coming
to grips with the story, you just can’t produce a good information graphic. If you
think you are going to skim across the top and treat it like some kind of art job,
it’s very unlikely that you are going to be much of a success. I don’t know how to
find or fuel that kind of passion, though.

Q I would say this passion you talk about reminds me of the passion good
educators nourish. It’s the need to be curious, to learn, and to tell others
about what you have learned. Journalists feel that kind of passion as well.
JG It’s really a journalistic passion, yes. In fact, some of the best people I have
worked with used to be traditional journalists until they realized the power of
visual storytelling. When you think about it, infographics and visualization are
really amazing tools for telling stories when used correctly, aren’t they?

Do wealthier countries take home more
Olympic medals? Conventional wisdom
suggests that they would. It’s no secret that
having the financial resources to invest in human
potential leads to success: The U.S. is the richest
country in the world and has won more Olympic
medals than any other nation. But if you introduce
some elementary math and divide a country’s medal
tally by its gross domestic product, the numbers
rearrange themselves dramatically. Ethiopia’s trackand-field
victories lift the poverty-stricken state to
the top of the pile, while economic powerhouses
like Japan, France, and the U.S. finish near the bottom.

Figure 10.9 “Medal
Exchange.” Condé Nast
Portfolio, 2008, by John
Grimwade: “This is an
interesting approach to
covering the Olympics
in a business magazine
just before the Beijing
games. We’re all used to
the conventional medals
table, but what happens
if the Athens medals
total is divided by the
GDP of the country?
Then we see who did
the most with the least
resources. Ethiopia is
the winner. The U.S. and
Japan are way down the
list.”

Do wealthier countries take home more
Olympic medals? Conventional wisdom
suggests that they would. It’s no secret that
having the financial resources to invest in human
potential leads to success: The U.S. is the richest
country in the world and has won more Olympic
medals than any other nation. But if you introduce
some elementary math and divide a country’s medal
tally by its gross domestic product, the numbers
rearrange themselves dramatically. Ethiopia’s trackand-field
victories lift the poverty-stricken state to
the top of the pile, while economic powerhouses
like Japan, France, and the U.S. finish near the bottom.
Here’s a look at our surprising results, based
on medal counts from the 2004 Summer Games in
Athens and G.D.P. data from the same year.

Figure 10.10 “The Manhattan Project,”
Condé Nast Traveler, 2002, by John Grimwade.
“One year after the September 11 attacks,
we ran a feature reminding our readers that
the downtown area of Manhattan still had a
lot to offer. It has stylized buildings, where
I tried to capture the essence of the building
rather than aerial-photograph accuracy,
and a clear street grid. This is very much my
graphic approach to making maps: Remove
the unnecessary detail, and focus on the
story. In 2003, I reworked the map into a
different format for a handout at the Society
of Publication Designers conference.” (See
Figure 10.11 to see the second map.)
