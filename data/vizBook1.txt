1. Why Visualize: From Information WisdomMy expertise has always been my ignorance, my admission and acceptance not knowing.... When you can admit that you don’t know, you are more likely ask questions that will enable you learn.—Richard Saul Wurman, from Information Anxiety 2Recently someone asked me what personality trait best characterizes those interested in a career in visualization and infographics. My answer: “An insatiable, childish curiosity.”Curiosity, combined with a tendency try explain everything using reason, led me a career in journalism and, later, specialize in information graphics. It not possible be a good communicator if you have not developed a keen interest in almost everything as well as an urge learn as much as you can about strangest, most varied, unrelated topics. The life a visual communicator should be one systematic and exciting intellectual chaos. In my case, it consists regular shifts between journalism, cognitive psychology, international politics, and history. In your case, it might be sports, music, architecture, or just about anything else.Let me give you an example how far healthy curiosity can take you.Rational OptimismMy original plan for this chapter was open it with a few formal definitions for information visualization, information design, and infographics. But something changed my mind. While randomly navigating The New York Times website, I stumbled on a review a book called The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, by British science essayist Matt Ridley (2010).The review1 was mostly critical, but hypotheses Ridley proposed sounded intriguing. The book honored its title, making a case for optimism about our future as a species. I had read other Ridley books in past and had loved his Genome: The Autobiography a Species in 23 Chapters (2006), so I was positively biased.1 William Easterly, “A High-Five for Invisible Hand,” The New York Times, June 11, 2010.My curiosity ignited, I grabbed my Kindle and purchased book. One minute later, it had finished downloading. For rest day, I traded book writing for reading. (Note my editor: I did it make this chapter better, I promise!) The book so well written that it was difficult put down before end.One chapter about fertility rate, or average number children born women in each country, caught my eye. You may have heard or read stories Malthusian doomsayers who claim that rising fertility in poor regions reason Earth has support 7 billion people, with a forecast 9 billion two decades from now, and even more in far future.Other doomsayers focus on aging populations developed countries where fertility rates are below 2.1 children per woman, a number that known as “replacement rate.” If replacement rate in a country significantly below 2.1, population will shrink over time. If it’s much higher than 2.1, you’ll have a much younger population down road, which can cause problems. Younger populations, for example, show greater rates violence and crime.Ridley contradicts both kinds apocalyptic thinking by discussing two interesting trends. On average, fertility in rich countries very low, but in past few years it has trended slightly upward. On other hand, poor countries show a decrease in average fertility. Contrary conventional wisdom, in many countries that verge on becoming first-world economies, such as Brazil, drop dramatic: fertility rate has trended from more than six children per woman in 1950 less than two in 2010.Ridley suggests that, due these two complementary trends, fertility rates everywhere will converge around 2.1 in a few decades, and world population will stabilize at 9 billion people. It’s counterintuitive, isn’t it?Ridley’s case compelling and supported by prospective data from reliable sources, such as United Nations (UN) and The World Bank.2 But something made me uncomfortable as I read his arguments. It took me a while figure out what it was. Ridley writes about curves and lines and trends, but chapter on fertility and population includes just one graphic, similar one in Figure 1.1.2 Matt Ridley, The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves (New York: Harper Collins).Figure 1.1. How much world population increases compared with previous year.The graphic simple and clear, but also insufficient support claims Ridley makes. All it shows that when you plot population change as a time-series chart, trend negative. The closer we get present, lower worldwide population growth. The fact that graphic an aggregate data all countries in world impedes our ability see multiple patterns Ridley discusses. Where are those rich countries whose fertility rate slowly recovering? Where evidence for assertion that developing countries such as Brazil, China, and India are stabilizing  populations?I told you before that I am curious. I didn’t just take a day off read The Rational Optimist. I also looked for data Ridley used for chapter on population. With that data, would I be able prove his hypotheses?Low-Tech Visualization RescueThe first thing I did was go United Nations website. If you search for “UN data,” you will quickly find http://data.un.org/, which a kind paradise if you like dig into huge databases on population, education, economics, and social development. Within UN site, I searched for fertility rate data. The UN’s figures begin in 1950; projections extend as far as 2100.I decided exclude years after 2010, playing with actual data (at that time) rather than forecasts. Using filters site offers, I asked for a table that included more than 150 countries on which UN has complete research. Figure 1.2 shows a screenshot what I obtained.Figure 1.2. UN data table.I downloaded table and decided try a low-tech visualization exercise show my students—mostly journalists with no technology background—that learning create information graphics not all that difficult.Using OpenOffice (an open source software suite that includes a spreadsheet program), I reorganized data and cleaned up table a little. Some cells were missing, so process involved a bit manual tweaking—no big deal. Figure 1.3 shows an excerpt result.Figure 1.3. My UN data table after tweaking.Still with me? Now fun begins. We have table in computer. Is it possible make sense it? Hardly. Extracting meaning from a table tough. Can you see any interesting trends just by reading figures? If you can, congratulations. You have an extraordinary memory. Most us mortals have brains that didn’t evolve deal with large amounts data. Let me prove it you: Look at Figure 1.3 again and tell me in what years between 1950 and 1975 did difference between fertility rates Spain and Sweden grow, and in what years did it drop?This apparently simple task forces you do something extremely difficult: look up a number, memorize it, read another one, memorize it and compare it with previous one, and so forth until you get end series. I wouldn’t bother.But what if I designed a simple chart with data in spreadsheet? The result (Figure 1.4) a visual tool that helps answer my question. The message in that graphic clear: Spain started 1950 with an average number children per woman higher than Sweden’s. But then fertility in Spain fell drastically after 1970 and only recovered partially in last five years series. On other hand, Sweden’s fertility rate has remained pretty stable over last 60 years, although it well below replacement level 2.1 children per woman.Figure 1.4. So much for Spanish pride.By giving numbers a proper shape, by visually encoding them, graphic has saved you time and energy that you would otherwise waste if you had use a table that was not designed aid your mind. The first and main goal any graphic and visualization be a tool for your eyes and brain perceive what lies beyond  natural reach.33 This idea has inspired some best books out there, including those Edward Tufte, William Cleveland, Stephen Few, and Stephen Kosslyn, among others. See Bibliography for references.However, presenting data for two countries far simpler than presenting data for one hundred them, which what we may need do in order put some Matt Ridley’s ideas test. Once we represent lines for all countries in our data set, we get something similar Figure 1.5. This colorful spaghetti dish may look interesting, but it’s totally useless for our purposes. This what you get when you let a software program do hard work for you.Figure 1.5. Too many lines obscure message.Remember, what we want reveal projected confluence lines rich countries (trending slightly up in recent years) and those poor countries (trending down) around 2.1 children per woman line. If you look at Figure 1.5 long enough, you may be able tell lines apart, but it’s more likely you will just give up.The way solve this problem add some visual hierarchy mix. Obviously it makes no sense for all lines be equally visible. In information graphics, what you show can be as important as what you hide. I put chart generated in OpenOffice into Adobe Illustrator, where I highlighted a few rich countries and a few developing and poor countries.I made other countries’ lines light gray, so they remain on scene but don’t obscure message. Why not get rid them? Because they provide context cases that I highlight. While changing all background lines one color makes it impossible see them as independent entities, collectively they show an overall downward trend in data—you can see that many lines begin between 6.0 and 8.0 children per woman point in 1950, but just a handful them remain at that height in vertical axis when they reach 2010. The final sketch in Figure 1.6 looks much more user-friendly than previous one.Figure 1.6. Highlighting relevant, keeping secondary in background.Excited by what I was revealing, I explored other assertions made in The Rational Optimist. Ridley argues that a sudden drop in a country’s fertility rate usually precipitated by several factors: an increase in average per capita income, women getting better access education, and shrinking infant mortality figures. The facts that more children survive  first years life and that women are spending more time in school are positively correlated better family planning.On economic side, Ridley explains that in rich countries, leisure options are everywhere, and they are cheap and accessible; distractions modern world free us, albeit partially, our primary impulse reproduce with no control. We can explain this phenomenon in bogus academic jargon: average number children per couple inversely proportional average amount hours each member that couple spends in front any kind screen. No kidding.To prove correlation between fertility, income, and women’s schooling, I designed two small scatter-plots in same spreadsheet software I used before. In Figure 1.7, each little circle represents a country. The position each country on horizontal axis proportional its fertility rate. The position on vertical axis equals average income per person (first chart) and percentage students in middle school who are female (second chart).Figure 1.7. The more educated and rich you are, fewer children you’ll have.The black line running between dots called a trend line or regression line: closer dots are this line, stronger correlation between two variables represented. You can see that dots are pretty close line, so variables are related. On average, richer people are, fewer children they tend have; and fewer girls who attend middle school, more children on average they have in that particular country.Here’s lesson I learned from this exercise: In just three or four hours work, I completed a personal project that allowed me see evidence supporting Matt Ridley’s discussion on evolution fertility. His hypotheses seem have some basis after all. But if you don’t present your data readers so they can see it, read it, explore it, and analyze it, why would they trust you? This a question many journalists, particularly those who write opinion columns, should ask themselves more often.Drowning in Data? Only If You Don’t Know How SwimThe example I just gave you was not chosen randomly. It helps us delve into topics that are essential understanding present state graphics as a form communication. Isn’t it amazing that we can read graphics at all, and use them discover realities otherwise invisible bare eye? In past two or three decades, psychology has unveiled many brain mechanisms involved in this kind understanding. Another thought: Did you notice that data I manipulated available on Internet for free? And isn’t it wonderful that tools I used prove Matt Ridley’s assertions are also broadly available anyone and can be learned in a matter hours?Those three trends have converged put visualization in mainstream. The design graphics not just more democratic than it was a decade ago, when data was sparse and software expensive and difficult use. We also have potential use graphics more intelligently because principles informing  design have never been clearer.Embracing graphics and visualization no trivial endeavor. Citing research by International Data Corp (IDC), The Economist reported that information generated in 2010 alone reached 1,200 exabytes,4 an amount equivalent thousands billions issues venerable British magazine. The story added that total amount extant digital information totals several zettabytes. Here’s a simple explanation help you grasp challenge we’re dealing with:4 “All too much: monstrous amounts data.” The Economist, Feb. 25, 2010.1 bit, or binary digit, basic unit information in computing. It represents either 0 or 1.1 byte (amount information necessary encode a letter or a number) = 8 bits1 kilobyte = 1,000 bytes1 megabyte = 1,000 kilobytes or 1,000,000 bytes (106)1 gigabyte = 1,000 megabytes or 1,000,000,000 bytes (109)1 terabyte = 1,000 gigabytes or 1,000,000,000,000 bytes (1012)1 petabyte = 1,000 terabytes or 1,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1015)1 exabyte = 1,000 petabytes or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1018)1 zettabyte = 1,000 exabytes or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1021)1 yottabyte = 1,000 zettabytes or 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 bytes (1024)Confused? Don’t worry. You’re not alone. A yottabyte information such a huge number that it impossible imagine. In August 2010, Erich Schmidt, former CEO Google, announced in a conference that between beginning time and 2003, humanity generated roughly five exabytes data, whereas we now produce same volume bits every two days.“The information explosion so profoundly larger than anyone ever thought,” said Schmidt. Five exabytes more than 200,000 years DVD-quality video.55 Google Atmosphere 2010 conference.To be fair, not all that “information” what you would call information in a colloquial conversation. Most it product automated processes and communications between computers, mobile phones, and other devices—nothing that a human brain can understand. But still.Let’s catch our breath here and move on.From Information WisdomIn 1970s, years before access Internet was universal, Richard Saul Wurman, then a professor architecture in North Carolina, predicted that oncoming information explosion would require intervention a new breed professionals trained in organizing data and making sense it. According Wurman, biggest challenge our species was about face was learn how navigate upcoming tsunami bits that was cresting horizon.Wurman called these people information architects. Their discipline, information architecture, has been defined by others as:• The structural design shared information environments;• The combination organization, labeling, search, and navigation systems within websites and intranets;• The art and science shaping information products and experiences support usability and findability;• An emerging discipline and community practice focused on bringing principles design and architecture digital landscape.Wurman suggests that one main goals information architecture help users avoid information anxiety, “black hole between data and knowledge.”People still have anxiety about how assimilate a body knowledge that expanding by nanosecond.... Information anxiety produced by ever-widening gap between what we understand and what we think we should understand.66 Wurman, p. 14.The gap better represented through diagram in Figure 1.8, which shows steps separating two extremes Wurman’s maxim. It based on several models known as DIKW Hierarchies (Data, Information, Knowledge, Wisdom). Although models have been criticized as simplistic and vague,7 they are useful for explaining what visualizations and graphics are about.7 David Weinberg, “The Problem with Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom Hierarchy,” Harvard Business Review, February 2010.Figure 1.8. From reality people’s brains.In diagram, unstructured information means reality, world out there in all its glorious complexity. Every phenomenon that can be perceived or measured can be described as information.Data are records observations. Data can be encoded as symbols (numbers and words) that describe and represent reality. In between unstructured information and data, you can see a first level encoding. Imagine a researcher studying fertility rate. The data would be records researcher makes in a spreadsheet, for instance: 2, 5, 6, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 3 (and so on) children per woman.The second level encoding takes us from data structured information. This happens when a communicator (a researcher, a journalist, or whomever) represents data in a meaningful way, using text, visuals, or other means. We can also say that this communicator has given shape data, so that relevant patterns become visible.Information consumption can lead higher knowledge on part audience, if its members are able perceive patterns or meaning data. It not a passive process; our brains are not hard drives that store stuff uncritically. When people see, read, or listen, they assimilate content by relating it  memories and experiences.We reach wisdom when we achieve a deep understanding acquired knowledge, when we not only “get it,” but when new information blends with prior experience so completely that it makes us better at knowing what do in other situations, even if they are only loosely related information from which our original knowledge came. Just as not all information we absorb leads knowledge, not all knowledge we acquire leads wisdom.Every step in our diagram implies higher order. When we see world, we unconsciously impose organization on unstructured information that our eyes gather and transmit brain. We create hierarchies. We don’t perceive everything in front us at once, as we’ll see later in this book. A moving entity, for instance, attracts our attention more than a static one, because movement may suggest an approaching threat. We therefore process position and identity moving object before paying attention anything else. Our brain gives meaning object, even if we are not aware reason why.In words Kevin Kelly, a famous philosopher technology, in his book What Technology Wants (2010):Minds are highly evolved ways structuring bits information that form reality. That what we mean when we say a mind understands; it generates order.So, without conscious effort, brain always tries close distance between observed phenomena and knowledge or wisdom that can help us survive. This what cognition means. The role an information architect anticipate this process and generate order before people’s brains try do it on  own.Making Reality VisibleToday, information architect refers broadly professions with very different sets tools and theoretical traditions. Outside academic circles, an information architect can be someone who writes technical handbooks, a software engineer, a web developer, a wayfinding designer (yes, that’s a profession; who do you think creates public spaces that can be navigated with ease?), and that nerdy guy who makes charts on fertility just for fun it.All those professions share goal making world easier for audiences and users, but that’s too broad a goal put them all in same bag. For my purposes in this book, information graphics and visualization a form information architecture. But how can we be more precise in describing relationship between branch and trunk?Look at Figure 1.9 and imagine information architecture as a big circle. Inside set disciplines devoted dealing with information. Among most relevant disciplines information design, defined by Stanford University’s Robert E. Horn as “art and science preparing information so that it can be used by human beings with efficiency and effectiveness.”8 The goal information designer prepare documents (both analog and digital) and spaces so they can be navigated effortlessly.8 Robert Jacobson, ed. Information Design, (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2000).Figure 1.9. Information graphics a form information design. Information design branches from information architecture.A significant part information design information graphics and visualization. Academic literature sometimes separates infographics from visualization and defines latter as “use computer-supported, interactive, visual representations data amplify cognition,”9 but I prefer more straightforward take Joan Costa, a famous Spanish professor design: To visualize “to make certain phenomena and portions reality visible and understandable; many these phenomena are not naturally accessible bare eye, and many them are not even visual nature.”109 Card, Stuart, Jock, Mackinlay, and Ben Shneiderman. 1999. Readings Information Visualization: Using Vision Think. San Francisco: Morgan Kauffmann.10 Joan Costa, La esquemática: visualizar la información (Barcelona: Editorial Paidós, Colección Paidós Estética 26, 1998). One best books I’ve read on visual representation information. No English version available, unfortunately.Why does Costa add that second part about not being necessarily visual nature? Because graphical displays can be either figurative or non-figurative. To understand figurative displays, think a map as a scaled portrait a geographical area, or a manual that explains through illustrations how use your new washing machine, or a news infographic on a catastrophic plane crash, like one in Figure 1.10 (pages 20 and 21), a superb project by Público, a medium-sized Spanish newspaper with a small but extremely talented graphics desk.Figure 1.10. Público (Spain). Plane crash in Barajas airport, Madrid, August 21, 2008. Infographic by Chiqui Esteban, Mónica Serrano, Álvaro Valiño.Other graphics that display abstract phenomena are non-figurative. In these, there no mimetic correspondence between what being represented and its representation. The relationship between those two entities conventional, not natural (see Figure 1.11). The unemployment rate doesn’t really resemble a grid multicolored rectangles, does it?Figure 1.11. The Wall Street Journal. Web chart U.S. Unemployment: A Historical View. (Reprinted with permission The Wall Street Journal, Copyright © 2010 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved Worldwide.)Visualization as a TechnologyLet me introduce an idea crucial premise this book: Visualization should be seen as a technology. That may sound odd. When someone mentions technology in a routine conversation, we usually think machines: MP3 players, cars, refrigerators, electric toothbrushes, lawn mowers, computers. But what do all those devices have in common? I don’t mean physically, but in  very essence:1. They are extensions ourselves. Canadian media thinker Marshall McLuhan was first advance this notion half a century ago. A lawn mower helps us keep our garden neat without having use our bare hands. An electric toothbrush reaches small spaces in between our teeth that would be impossible reach with a toothpick—which also a technology, by way. An MP3 player not just a player, but also a device that helps us remember songs that define best and worst moments our lives.2. They are means reach goals. Sometimes it’s just one goal—a freezer keeps food fresh—but it can be several. Think a computer, whose functionality depends on other technologies such as software that we install. Technologies can harbor other technologies.Visualization as technology has these same traits. Also, word technology has various meanings and potentially open interpretation. I use it here with sense given by W. Brian Arthur in his foundational The Nature Technology (2009). According Arthur, we can use word technology in three different senses, illustrated in Figure 1.12: Technologies-singular, technologies-plural, and technology-general.Figure 1.12. The three kinds technology: general, plural, and singular.What Arthur means that technology can be, first, any object, process, or method devised aid in a task, “a means fulfill a human purpose.” This can be called technology-singular. The refrigerator and other devices described above are examples. The algorithms that run a software program as well as letters, sentences, and paragraphs that help me communicate with you are also technologies-singular. Even a humble nail a technology.Technologies-plural describe “assemblages practices and components.” In other words, they are groups technology-singular items that, when put together, make something new emerge. Electronics, biochemistry, and varieties engineering are all technologies-plural. Arthur also refers technology-plural groups as “bodies technology.”The third meaning technology “entire collection devices and engineering practices available a culture,” or technology-general.How this relevant for information graphics and visualization? First, as emerging disciplines, they are still a formative hodge-podges concepts, methods, and procedures borrowed from many areas: principles map design (from cartography); guidelines on how better display data on a chart (from statistics); rules on best practices for use type, layout, and color palettes (from graphic design); principles writing style (from journalism); and more, including a wide array software tools.Second, and more important, individual information graphics are also technologies, means fulfill purposes, devices whose aim help an audience complete certain tasks. This apparent no-brainer will have consequences later on. If you accept that a visualization is, above all, a tool, you are implicitly accepting that discipline it belongs not just art, but functional art, something that achieves beauty not through subjective, freely wandering self-expression painter or sculptor, but through careful and restrained tinkering engineer.  
2. Forms and Functions: Visualization as a TechnologyThe usefulness a graph can be evaluated only in context type data, questions designer wants readers answer, and nature audience.—Stephen M. Kosslyn, from Graph Design for Eye and MindThe fact that an information graphic designed help us complete certain intellectual tasks what distinguishes it from fine art. Rather than serving as a means for artist express her inner world and feelings, an infographic or visualization strives for objectivity, precision, and functionality, as well as beauty. In short:The function constrains form.In this chapter I will explore this idea and its usefulness for infographics and visualization, starting with original phrase “form follows function,” and critiques and iterations it has undergone over time. The original idea remains same, but these iterations contribute a more nuanced understanding what relationship between forms and functions entails.An Information Graphic on DefenseLet’s start with a real-life example illustrate what I mean. Although Brazil a huge country and main power in South America, its armed forces are not on par with its status as sixth-largest economy in world. Proportionally, some Brazil’s neighbors, such as Venezuela and Chile, invest much more each year in keeping  armies, naval fleets, and air forces up date. And that’s an issue: Brazilians are proud  newly earned status as an almost-developed nation, and they want world know about it. So, in August 2008, Brazilian government announced a new strategic defense plan, culmination a public discussion that had begun many years before.Brazil’s main newspaper Folha de São Paulo. It has biggest information graphics staff in country, full great talent. Folha dedicated an entire page then-President Lula da Silva’s new strategic plan. It was a critical story, explaining that some defense investments were not well planned, and that some Brazil’s rivals in region were better focused on what was really needed defend  territories and offshore waters.Two information graphics accompanied story. The first detailed Brazilian defense budget for 2009. The second, which was source for Figure 2.1, was titled “The Defense Neighbors: An overview armed forces countries surrounding Brazil.”Figure 2.1. A portrait power balance in South America.I will use Figure 2.1 demonstrate an exercise I recommend you try whenever you see an information graphic in a newspaper, magazine, book, or website. Practice this exercise and it will help you become an infographics and visualization expert. The first part simple. Ask yourself:What does designer want me do with this graphic?In other words: If we accept that an infographic is, at its core, a tool, what tasks this one intended help me with? Here my personal list for Brazilian defense graphic:1. The graphic must present several variables—armed forces personnel, population be defended, defense budget, and so forth—so that I have proper information in front me.2. It should allow comparisons. At a glance, I should be able tell which country has biggest and smallest army, more or less populated, or invests more heavily or lightly in its military.3. It should help me organize countries, from biggest smallest, based on variables and comparisons.4. It should make correlations or relationships evident me. For instance, are population and size defense forces directly and perfectly proportional?Of those four possible tasks—present, compare, organize, correlate—graphic accomplishes just one satisfactorily. It presents tons variables and values. But it doesn’t show them in proportion one another. This makes it impossible for readers dig into data.Imagine you’re a concerned Brazilian patriot. Your first impulse will probably be compare your country with Venezuela and Argentina, Brazil’s main commercial and strategic rivals in region. See how difficult this operation is? If you want compare, say, population, you will have read all numbers, memorize them, and then organize them in your head. The same thing happens when you try compare countries’ defense budgets.You need a pretty powerful memory do that. From a functional standpoint, there’s little difference between this graphic and a simple table. The graphic may be prettier, but it still makes you work too hard extract basic meanings.There’s something else: Does map need be main visual element in composition? I doubt it. Using so much real estate for map suggests that main goal graphic show where Brazil’s neighboring countries are—and likely most or all Folha de São Paulo’s readers know that already.To be fair in my remarks, I know that a single Folha de São Paulo designer had just two hours produce this infographic after obtaining data from a reporter. That’s how things work in newspapers. Turnaround times for breaking-news projects are tight. Still, I believe that graphic could have been greatly improved with 10 or 15 minutes planning.Here’s where second part our exercise begins.What Shape Should My Data Have?Once we have listed goals our graphic should help accomplish, it’s time consider what shape numbers should adopt.Let’s start with comparison. As originally published, infographic doesn’t make our lives easy. The numbers are there, but populations and budgets are not visually represented. Comparing figures mentally—which what we are forcing readers do if they want get an idea proportional sizes those variables in different countries—is too hard.Military personnel are represented by tiny silhouettes, each equivalent 1,000 soldiers. But in original, symbols are useless because bars formed by little soldiers do not sit on same horizontal axis. This makes comparisons more difficult than they should be. See how much easier things are if we place columns soldiers side by side, as shown in Figure 2.2.Figure 2.2. Simply placing bars on same horizontal axis allows you make more accurate comparisons.If you accept that bars facilitate comparison better than other ways encoding variables, let’s represent countries’ military personnel as bars and organize them from biggest smallest amounts. In Figure 2.3 you can see result: Readers can now easily identify winners and losers in South American arms race (I’m being a bit hyperbolic), a task that required far more cognitive energy in original Folha de São Paulo graphic.Figure 2.3. Let’s get rid pictograms and use a traditional bar chart.At this point we face a challenge. It would seem Brazil will be winner in all rankings, because bigger population a country has, bigger its military forces and heftier its defense budget will be. But this relationship perfectly proportional? In other words, if population n times bigger in one country than in another, will armed forces also be n times larger?This question related fourth task, correlation among variables. The bars in previous figure don’t address that goal. That because they encode absolute figures.Think about it this way: What if you want compare violent crime in Detroit, Michigan, against figures in Poughkeepsie, New York? You would never use an absolute variable, such as total number people killed, because Detroit much bigger than Poughkeepsie, so total number crimes will also be enormous.Instead, you would choose a derived variable; that is, you would obtain number homicides in each city, divide it by population, and then multiply result by 100,000. You would then get homicides per 100,000 people.The same can be applied our Brazilian defense graphic. See what happens when we control armed forces sizes by population, or when we calculate per capita spending in defense? The rankings look much different. Compared with Figure 2.3, Figure 2.4 gives readers an additional and useful level depth and understanding: The biggest armies in absolute terms may not be biggest ones in relative terms. In relative terms, our Brazilian patriot would surely be alarmed, because her country ranks second from bottom. Countries like Venezuela and Bolivia are more militarized, and Colombia far ahead because its war on narco-guerrillas.Figure 2.4. The country rankings change quite a bit when you encode secondary variables instead absolute numbers.Are there ways representing correlations using absolute variables? Sure. You could design a scatter-plot, a type chart mentioned in Chapter 1. In redesign I put together after thinking about Folha de São Paulo’s original graphic (Figure 2.5), I included another version titled, “A different look at data.” If this were a real project, I would not have done this because it tells essentially same story as two sets bar charts, but it illustrates an important point: In most cases, there not just one way encoding a particular set data properly. You may have more than one option, but your goal must be always think first about what kinds questions readers are more likely want answered by your infographic.Figure 2.5. A different take on defense infographic.The Origins “Form Follows Function”The maxim “form follows function” was born in 1896 when American architect Louis Sullivan wrote an article titled, “The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered.” In it, Sullivan discussed needs occupants big office buildings, which had begun proliferate at end nineteenth century. The most widely cited paragraph is:All things in nature have a shape, that say, a form, an outward semblance, that tells us what they are, that distinguishes them from ourselves and from each other. Unfailing in nature these shapes express inner life, native quality animal, tree, bird, fish, that they present us; they are so characteristic, so recognizable, that we say, simply, it “natural” it should be so (...) It pervading law all things organic and inorganic, all things physical and metaphysical, all things human and all things superhuman, all true manifestations head, heart, soul, that life recognizable in its expression, that form ever follows function. This law.11 Louis Sullivan, “The Tall Office Building Artistically Considered,” Lippincott’s Magazine, March, 1896, accessed Feb. 11, 2012, http://academics.triton.edu/faculty/fheitzman/tallofficebuilding.html.Those highlighted words were defining for twentieth-century architecture and had an enormous influence on contemporary masters, either because they embraced them (Bauhaus school), or because they rejected them or introduced  own nuances (Frank Lloyd Wright). Some most renowned ideas luminaries like Le Corbusier, who defined a house as “a machine for living in,” connect directly Sullivan.Today, we interpret Sullivan’s idea as a call center any design, regardless its nature—a building, a tool, a software program—on user. However, that was not exactly what Sullivan had in mind when he wrote his article. His “function” not a goal in sense a task that tool designed help achieve, but rather, an intrinsic property both artificial and natural entities, a kind essence. According Sullivan, form a thing a clue its nature.The fact that we misinterpret Sullivan one those fortunate paradoxes that make history colorful. Taken in a literal sense, original paragraph includes several fallacies worth discussing before we can understand relationship between form and function in visualization.Consider this:All things in nature have a shape ..., an outward semblance, that tells us what they are .... Unfailing in nature these shapes express inner life, native quality animal, tree, bird, fish, that they present us.If you remember something from your high school biology classes, you’ll understand why this appealing at first but ultimately absurd. If we follow Sullivan’s rationale, we could hypothesize, as pre-modern thinkers did, that fishes and dolphins belong same animal order, because shapes  bodies are pretty much identical. Or we could say that hippopotami are cousins elephants and rhinoceros, since all three share features such as thick legs and bodies, and tons body fat under hard skins. But, as always happens in science, evidence (in this case, genetics) contradicts appearances. The hippopotamus descended from whales that evolved return from sea land.2 Never trust your intuitions without testing them.2 Carl Zimmer, At Water’s Edge (New York: Touchstone, 1999).Even in world technology, idea that shape an object unequivocally connected its functions not valid. True, a spoon concave and solid so no liquid can fall through it, so one can deduce that we can use it bring liquid food our mouths. But what about an iPod? Does shape its central wheel naturally suggest way it should be used? Hardly. In this case, connection between form and function must be learned. It in reflections such as these that we see that Sullivan’s law cannot be strictly applied.More about Functions in NatureAnother problem with Sullivan’s law that sentence “form follows function” indicates that relationship between two components unidirectional. At first this seems intuitive. After all, what are a couple feather-covered wings for, if not for flying? If wings have evolved, it must be because some animals felt need flee from predators or reach fruits growing on treetops.The problem that world doesn’t work that way. A species doesn’t feel a need first (function) and then develops an organ fulfill it (form). If you’ve ever had this kind thought—some people still do—you’ve fallen prey what known as Lamarckian Fallacy.Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who lived between nineteenth and twentieth centuries, was one first scientists describe mechanism that guides evolution. In his time, evidence existed linking living species usually extinct ancestors, who in turn were heirs even older ancestors, and so on, in a chain dating beginning time. What Lamarck and other scientists had not discovered was hidden logic this phenomenon, underlying force that leads one animal or vegetable become a completely different one given enough time.Lamarck proposed a scientific theory called “inheritance acquired characteristics.” To understand it, let’s consider giraffes, a descendant ancient creatures that supposedly were similar modern antelopes. How did giraffe evolve its long neck?According Lamarckian logic, thousands and thousands years ago, some antelopes felt need feed on tree leaves beyond reach  mandibles. They began stretching  necks get them. As a consequence, they were born with slightly longer necks than previous generation. But this like saying that if I start doing heavy bodybuilding today and become a clone Sylvester Stallone, my kids will be born with steel muscles. To followers Lamarckism, form literally follows function. The former pushes latter.Thanks Charles Darwin, though, we now know that evolution doesn’t work that way. Darwin’s On Origin Species was published in 1859 and offered an alternative Lamarck’s hypothesis. The force that moves evolution forward not acquisition characteristics and skills inherited by kin, but natural selection traits that help an organism survive in its environment. What Darwin did was invert Lamarck’s logic: Function doesn’t determine form. In fact, in many cases, opposite true.First, let’s be clear about what Darwin meant by natural selection. Back our friend giraffe, a Darwinian narrative its origin might run like this:3 Many generations ago, ancestors giraffe lived in grasslands and forests and fed on vegetation. Every time a new calf was born, it could have a neck that was slightly longer or shorter than its parents because tiny mutations in its DNA (Darwin didn’t know about DNA, but it doesn’t matter; he did know that children look very much like  parents.) This called variation.3 The giraffe story has not been confirmed but plausible. See “On origin, evolution and phylogeny giraffes Giraffa camelopardalis,” by G. Mitchell and J. D. Skinner, Transactions Royal Society South Africa, 58 (1), 2003, pp. 51-72. Accessed Feb. 11, 2012 from http://www.bringyou.to/GiraffeEvolution.pdf.In a particular moment in time—maybe because a drought made grass scarce, or because some pre-giraffe families moved savannahs where food was difficult find—having a slightly longer neck than your kin suddenly became an advantage. You could feed on tree leaves that were far from ground.The pre-giraffes that had longer necks tended live longer and have better health (on average) than  congeners. They also reproduced more and passed longer-neck gene mutations  offspring. Successive mutations leading even longer necks may have given subsequent generations an even bigger competitive advantage, in a fortuitous circle.In other words, need reach higher every day (function) didn’t force development longer necks (form). Longer necks were result random genetic mutations that were nonrandomly filtered (that is, selected) by environment. In nature, then, relationships between forms and functions are much more complex than what Sullivan thought.Another factor also counters idea a cause-effect relationship between functions and forms. Remember our question, “What are a couple feather-covered wings for, if not for flying?” Well, wings were certainly not for flying at first. Birds descended from dinosaurs that began evolve feathers not for flight, but for maintaining body temperature and attracting mates. The functions feathers—that is,  competitive advantages—were keep  owner warm and make creature more handsome.But evolution eventually crossed paths with another possible function: control movement air around feathered extremities, which allowed a primitive form gliding. This an example what paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called exaptation, by which a trait that evolves in response an environmental challenge used for an entirely different purpose (flying).44 Stephen Jay Gould and Elisabeth Vrba, “Exaptation – A Missing Term in Science Form, Paleontology,” 8(1), Winter, 1982, 4-15.Exaptations are common in technology as well. The Internet could be analyzed as an exaptation. Designed enhance communication between scientists, it ended up being adopted by public as a virtual world that facilitates many kinds human sharing. Guttenberg’s printing press was based on technologies previously used crush grapes and make wine. The original function presses was crush grapes, and  form was well suited that function. It just happened that someone eventually saw that form those machines could have an entirely different function.55 Steven Johnson, Where Good Ideas Come From: The Natural History Innovation (New York: Penguin Group, 2010).Cases such as these help us understand that relationship between forms and functions bidirectional. Form doesn’t always follow function; in many cases, function follows a form that previously followed another unrelated function. It easy imagine one our ancestors, hundreds thousands years ago, walking through woods and finding a sharp triangular rock. Our ancestor picks up rock and notices that it perfectly fits palm his hand. What function that form? None, until our ancestor sees a goal that matches what rock’s shape suggests: It may be used for cutting fur, flesh, and bone. Nature becomes technology through eyes and mind an intelligent agent.Functions Constrain FormsThe fact that Louis Sullivan was misguided in his coarse essentialism doesn’t disprove idea that forms and functions are and must be closely related. It true, as we just have seen, that function doesn’t necessarily determine form. But it also true that form a technological object must depend on tasks it should help with. This one most important principles remember when dealing with infographics and visualizations: The form should be constrained by functions your presentation. There may be more than one form a data set can adopt so that readers can perform operations with it and extract meanings, but data cannot adopt any form. Choosing visual shapes encode information should not be based on aesthetics and personal tastes alone.In general, better defined goals an artifact, narrower variety forms it can adopt. Let me illustrate this principle with several real-world examples.More than a decade ago, I worked for several print newspapers in Spain and became familiar with templates used for stories that repeat on a regular basis. This common practice in news media: If you know that you will publish, say, an infographic on unemployment rate every month, or a weather page every day, why would you design a new graphic for each occasion? Using templates saves time. Unfortunately, it also encourages inertia. Bringing up template file over and over again invites you not think deeply about its structure and appropriateness. Just open it, update it with new data, save it, and move on more interesting stuff.The infographic in Figure 2.6 similar template many newspapers in Spain use publish monthly government data on unemployment. It presents all numbers and includes a layer information that aggregates them, offering a quick overview data. Three different tones gray represent higher-than-average, on-average, and below-average employment regions. But let’s apply a little question-based critique test it. Try answer these questions in less than five seconds each:1. In which region has unemployment grown most?2. In which one has it dropped most?3. Has unemployment change been bigger in Madrid, La Rioja, or Canarias?4. Has unemployment dropped more in Extremadura, Andalucía, or Baleares?Figure 2.6. A type graphic very common in Spanish newspapers: monthly unemployment rate change.Likely, you can’t do it. I did not ask myself such questions when I was designing these kinds graphics, but I do now. My perspective has changed. I no longer think like a designer, but like a reader. And, as a reader, those are kinds answers that I want get using this kind tool.The challenge this graphic similar one we analyzed in first pages this chapter. Here’s what happens when you try complete any operations above:1. Your eyes look for numbers mentioned in question.2. Your brain memorizes them.3. Your brain organizes numbers from biggest smallest (or vice versa).4. Your brain compares reorganized numbers.That’s too much work. If we know that readers are likely look for how  own region fits into big picture, why not anticipate it? Figure 2.7 represents exactly same data, but offers more options explore them.Figure 2.7. This variation unemployment rate graphic allows you compare and rank Spain’s regions.Again, map: Is it necessary? Perhaps. In this case, geographical location regions may be relevant, as it shows that unemployment getting worse in southeast Spain.In an interview with Technical Communication Quarterly in 2004, Edward Tufte, arguably most influential theoretician in visualization and information design (which he prefers call analytical design), defined relationship between form and function succinctly:Effective analytic designs entail turning thinking principles into seeing principles. So, if thinking task understand causality, task calls for a design principle: “Show causality.” If a thinking task answer a question and compare it with alternatives, design principle is: “Show comparisons.” The point that analytical designs are not be decided on  convenience user or necessarily  readability or what psychologists or decorators think about them; rather, design architectures should be decided on how architecture assists analytical thinking about evidence.66 Mark Zachary and Charlotte Thralls, “An Interview with Edward Tufte,” Technical Communication Quarterly, 2004, 13(4), 447-462. Accessed Feb. 11, 2012 at http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/s15427625tcq1304_5.pdf.Clear enough. But this idea not as obvious as it should be, as previous examples prove. A simple Google search on infographics will return thousands links projects in which designer didn’t choose graphic forms according how well they assist thinking, but because they looked cool, innovative, or funny. Designers who don’t develop crucial skill asking themselves, “What my graphic for?” are easy victims fashion. No fashion plague more prevalent as I write this book than bubble.The Bubble PlagueThe overuse bubble charts in news media a good example how infographics departments can become more worried about how  projects look than with how they work. When I give presentations, I often use charts like one in Figure 2.8, which I made up based on a real project by Bloomberg News.Figure 2.8. Banks as shrinking bubbles. How appropriate. This example inspired by an article by Stephen Few: “Our Irresistible Fascination with All Things Circular”: http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/our_fascination_with_all_things_circular.pdfWhen I ask audience for  reaction graphic, answer usually is, “I don’t see a problem. It clear that value all banks in chart fell dramatically during 2007–2008 economic meltdown.” I agree; that’s what I see as well. Immediately, I show a different slide, Figure 2.9, and ask, “If you know that Société Générale’s market capitalization was $80 billion in 2007, how much was it in 2009?” (Try answer question without looking at Figure 2.8.)Figure 2.9. The first bubble represents $80 billion. What percentage that does second bubble represents? Half, perhaps?According my informal records, more than 70 percent attendees guess that answer slightly more than $40 billion. In other words, they see smaller bubble as being half size bigger one.Then I switch Figure 2.10 and tell them that length bars display exactly same numbers as areas bubbles. This figure makes it clear that value Société Générale in 2009 was around one third what it was in 2007. The surprised looks I get when they see this are a lot fun.Figure 2.10. Our friend, bar chart, comes rescue.Why do so many people overestimate number for 2009 in bubble chart? Because human brain not good at calculating surface sizes. It much better at comparing a single dimension such as length or height. As we’ll see in second section this book, brain also a hopelessly lazy machine. When faced with question whether that bear running toward you big enough pose a threat, brain doesn’t waste time or energy analyzing if bear tall and wide. Seeing if it’s just tall good enough. In Figure 2.11, what you want your readers compare (areas) on left; what they actually compare (diameters) on right.Figure 2.11. You want readers compare areas, but they tend compare heights.The objection I usually hear when I build my case against bubbles as a means facilitate precise comparisons between magnitudes is, “I understand your point, but you’re cheating. You’ve hidden all values. If you hadn’t done so, there’d be no problem.” Granted, but in that case, what do you need bubbles for? Bubbles are misleading. They make you underestimate differences. In Figure 2.8, consider Santander Bank. Can you tell without reading numbers that its value in 2009 was half what it was in 2007? I’ll bet you can’t. If you are as absent-minded as I am and don’t pay close attention graphic, you may walk away with idea that Santander didn’t suffer much during crisis.If bubbles have no functional purpose, why not design a simple and honest table? Because circles look good. They are decorative.Are there other ways design this chart respecting Edward Tufte’s principle transforming thinking principles into design principles? Certainly. As we discussed earlier, function doesn’t dictate form. It constrains your options, but you still have options. You can design a chart that not only allows comparisons, but also focuses on changes that occurred between two years. (See Figure 2.12.)Figure 2.12. A chart that represents change.Is it always wrong represent numbers with bubbles? No. Let’s return our most cherished principle infographic as a tool whose shapes should be chosen according intended goals. The banks infographic supposed help us make precise comparisons between values. But see map in Figure 2.13, published by The New York Times after 2004 presidential elections. Each circle represents margin votes in those counties won by John Kerry (blue) or by George W. Bush (red). In cartography, this kind map called a proportional symbol map.Figure 2.13. A proportional symbol map appropriate when your goal visualize big picture. It allows you perceive general patterns and trends.Why was bank infographic ineffective, whereas this map works? The reason lies in  goals. The goal election map not that readers should be able accurately compare Manhattan’s bubble with Houston’s. It would take a different kind chart facilitate that task. The goal here help readers identify general patterns concentration Democratic and Republican votes.More Flexible Than It SeemsI don’t want you leave this chapter with impression that choosing right graphic forms for each story an easy task. It tempting propose rock-solid rules—if you want show change through time, use a time-series chart; if you need compare, use a bar chart; or display correlation, use a scatter-plot— because some these rules make good common sense. There even evidence supporting use certain kinds charts for particular goals. (See Figure 2.14.)Figure 2.14. Three very common kinds charts: (from left right, time series chart, bar chart, and scatter-plot chart.But reality complex, and hard-and-fast rules can transform sound advice into immovable law. Exceptions and nuances can arise with particularities each project. What really important remember that no matter how creative and innovative you wish be in your graphics and visualizations, first thing you must do, before you put a finger on computer keyboard, ask yourself what users are likely try do with your tool.  		3. The Beauty Paradox: Art and CommunicationNo one can write decently who distrustful reader’s intelligence, or whose attitude patronizing.—E. B. White, from The Elements StyleLearning deal with frustration part professional life. So being able explain what you do and why you do it. I kept repeating those maxims myself on November 1, 2010, after weekly news magazine I worked for, Época, published what I considered a decent graphic about prison population in Brazil.It all began two weeks before. As magazine’s infographics director, one my responsibilities was coordinate a two-page section called “Diagram,” a news story told through short pieces text, statistical charts, maps, and illustrations. “Diagram” was our big infographic week, and we put a lot effort and resources into it.From January 2010, when I was hired, that moment in November, we had published more than 30 “Diagrams,” each a detailed visual description subjects as diverse as demographics; spaceships; boats made thousands recycled plastic bottles (its name Plastiki); and election results, with a wide assortment other data-based stories besides.Part my job was dream up potential stories for “Diagrams,” so I read several newspapers a day looking for inspiration. An item published by Estado de São Paulo, one Brazil’s three largest newspapers, caught my eye. It contained data recently released by Ministry Justice revealing a surge in number prison inmates over previous four years. Surprisingly, although Estado cited ministry’s exhaustive database, it did not include a chart.Stories about packed prisons in Brazil are nothing new. The problem dates a military dictatorship that ruled country between 1964 and 1985, and, paradoxically, it has only gotten worse as police and judiciary have become more efficient. More efficiency leads more criminals behind bars, which good, but it also pressures federal and state governments keep up by building more facilities. There’s never enough money for that.When dealing with a story that people are already familiar with, what you lack in novelty must be compensated for with depth. After all, journalism not just about covering news, but also about providing context for news.Building a Narrative StructureAs I was downloading and organizing data from Brazilian Ministry Justice, Humberto Maia, a talented young reporter, telephoned sources who could explain what numbers meant. He spoke with public officials, sociologists, and human rights advocates.We decided create a stand-alone graphic with four parts:1. A comparison Brazil’s prison system and those other countries between 1997 and 2007. We had found a United Nations report showing that Brazil ranked fifth in prison population growth over those years and first in Americas. Its number inmates grew 150 percent in that decade.2. A list Brazilian states with most drastic inmate increases between 2007 and 2010, based on Ministry Justice data. We decided calculate number inmates per 100,000 people in each state, as this measure allows a fair comparison regions with different-sized populations. Had we used absolute numbers, states with more inhabitants, such as São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, would always rank first.3. A graphic that showed imbalance between number prison inmates and number spaces for them in jails. In worst cases, like state Acre, there were more than two prisoners per space. We included those figures.4. Explanations highlighting most surprising numbers. Designers sometimes forget that in many cases an infographic a narrative based on charts, maps, and diagrams, in which text crucial.Our next step was devise a structure that would make sense data. We decided use headlines guide readers through information:1. Between 1997 and 2007, Brazil experienced fifth-largest increase in prison population in world;2. The trend has continued since 2007; and3. Government has not kept pace with growing prison population by building sufficient accommodations.Figure 3.1 shows infographic we published.Figure 3.1. Época magazine (São Paulo, Brazil). Originally published in Portuguese on November 1, 2010.We ended up with a two-page, graphics-based story told in several layers increasing depth and complexity that readers could explore at  leisure. While we could have restrained ourselves and merely summarized data, I reasoned that readers living in Rio Grande do Norte, Tocantins, or Amazonas would want analyze how  home states compared with others and with country averages. They would want details in terms granular data. On seeing story in print, I believed we had created an acceptable and interesting graphic.Not everyone agreed.An Unexpectedly Controversial ChartThe Época newsroom finishes working on each issue by Friday evening. The magazine hits newsstands Saturday morning. That gives executive editors—myself among them at time—a chance look over stories and prepare for a critique meeting that takes place every Monday morning before next edition planned.On Monday, November 1, 2010, I arrived in newsroom five minutes before meeting started. Anticipating a routine critique, I basked in lingering feeling peaceful drowsiness after a particularly nice, quiet weekend. Nothing prepared me for what happened next.“I feel compelled say that this week’s ‘Diagram’ horrible,” said one executive editors. “We should strive become more popular. Our average reader not going be able understand something as complex as this.”The comment unleashed a firestorm. “I think this graphic not friendly enough. No one will read it,” said another colleague.The director took a turn: “The problem not complexity. The infographic not hard understand. The problem that it ugly.”“In my opinion, it has too much information,” another colleague said.Holy crap! I was flabbergasted. Patiently, I waited for everyone finish tearing our project down, giving myself a chance cool off. Then, I explained reasoning behind piece: gathering data, structure, narrative, depth. No one was convinced. It really wasn’t my goal convince them. The critique meeting not place persuade others how good your work is, but hear suggestions for how improve it.Even if I disagreed with objections, and even if, one year later, graphic would go on win a Malofiej Infographics award, highest honor in infographics field, I took comments heart. In fact, they led me revisit a question that generations designers have pondered:What does “ugly” mean when used describe an infographic?That is, what did my colleagues, whose combined journalism experience totaled more than 100 years, really mean when they said that graphic was horrible, too complex, and that it could scare readers away?The Visualization WheelAfter meeting, I took a couple hours off reflect. I grabbed a pen and paper and began sketching and taking notes, which helps me think. I listed my colleagues’ opinions. According them, our graphic was:1. Too complex2. Too abstract3. Too far from aesthetics a majority our readers expect (“ugly”)4. Too denseI discovered  critique could be summarized using a conceptual device I had developed while writing my first book, Infografía 2.0 (2008, no English version available): visualization wheel. See Figure 3.2.Figure 3.2. The visualization wheel.The visualization wheel’s axes correspond main features you need balance when you design an information graphic. For this reason, I also refer it as tension wheel. The idea isn’t so original: It’s based on a similar wheel in Chapter 1 Joan Costa’s La Esquemática (see bibliography). My wheel includes several changes and more axes.A word warning before we move on: The visualization wheel an aid I use for thinking about my own graphics. The position along each axis therefore very subjective, so it unlikely you’ll be able use it for academic or quantitative analyses. It an exercise in meta-visualization: a visualization for planning visualizations.Let’s see how wheel works.The outer layer divided into two hemispheres, each with six features. The upper hemisphere’s features define graphics that are deeper and more complex. By complex I mean amount effort readers have invest in deciphering a particular graphic. Depth number layers information a graphic includes.It possible for a graphic be complex and shallow if you use a funky graphic form encode irrelevant data, or simple and deep if you encode tons data with common graphic forms. But, in general, complexity and depth are related variables in information graphics and visualizations. Graphics containing a good amount data tend be more difficult read, but are also more rewarding and enlightening.Let’s look at axes.Abstraction-FigurationAn information graphic (or a portion it) completely figurative when relationship between referent and its representation perfectly mimetic. The more distant representation and its referent are, more abstract infographic will be: For example, a realistic illustration a person more figurative than a pictorial symbol person. In extreme cases, there will be no natural relationship between two, and in those cases we would say that connection between referent and representation conventional.You can see this axis at work in two scenes a single interactive graphic mine about NASA Cassini-Huygens Mission Saturn. See Figure 3.3.Figure 3.3. Cassini-Huygens Mission: http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/graficos/jun/s4/cassini.html.The graphic in top image more figurative. The illustration resembles object it intends explain. The graphic at bottom displaying distances between planets in solar system much more abstract. In general, more closely a graphic reproduces a material reality, more figurative it will be.On other hand, if representation involves significant conceptual manipulation on part designer, it will tend be more abstract. In case Saturn mission graphic, I consciously reduced realism planets transform them into simple color circles, and I placed them on top a distance scale—another conceptual item device.Functionality-DecorationA graphic can be functional and visually pleasing, obviously, but here I am not considering stylistic elements that improve readability, such as correct use elegant fonts and carefully crafted color palettes. This axis refers inclusion visual elements that are not directly used enhance comprehension material.Take another look at Brazilian prison graphic (Figure 3.1). Do you see barbed wire? That’s what I would call a non-functional visual element. It’s decoration. Decoration not bad per se, but it can interfere with information in a chart if not handled well.Density-LightnessThe position an infographic occupies on this axis related amount data it displays in relation space it uses. See two graphics in Figure 3.4, which my colleagues and I created at Época magazine. Although almost equal in size, graphics offer very different amounts information. The first graphic very dense; second, very light, although still informative.Figure 3.4. “Megaramp: Skate Boarding Competition in São Paulo,” and “How Brown Capuchine Macaque Hunts Termites.”Multidimensionality-UnidimensionalityThis axis a measure two related variables: number layers depth a graphic lets readers navigate, and different forms it uses encode data.Consider our prison graphic. I believe that this one leans toward multidimensionality side wheel, because it gives readers opportunity dig into data quite deeply. Also, in case relationship between number inmates and jail spaces in different states, it lets them see same data in different ways.Another example multidimensional infographics Figure 3.5, published by The New York Times right after 2004 U.S. presidential elections. The popular vote represented by county and by population density. The electoral vote shown state by state in a standard choropleth map (a map that uses different colors and shades) and in a cartogram (a map that distorts relative size regions proportionally a variable—in this case, number electoral votes each state has). On top composition proportional symbol map I discussed at end Chapter 2, “Forms and Functions: Visualization as a Technology.”Figure 3.5. The New York Times. Reproduced with permission.Originality-FamiliaritySome graphic forms have become so common that they are almost as readable as text. Think bar charts, line charts, and pie charts. This has not always been so, course. In late eighteenth century, when use such charts was first systematized and theorized by polymath William Playfair, they were considered revolutionary, albeit understandable.However, explosion use information graphics and visualization in many areas—from academic computer science departments PR and marketing companies and more—has fueled a desire innovate new graphical forms. An example a form that today some people would find new or challenging theme rivers (also called stream graphs), for instance. See one in Figure 3.6, made by Periscopic, an information visualization firm, for Yahoo!. It shows keywords processed by Yahoo! Mail over a 30-second period. Word size and line width denote volume occurrence. Spam keywords are shown in gray.Figure 3.6. An example a stream graph. ©2011 Yahoo! Designed by Periscopic (http://periscopic.com/).Novelty-RedundancyAn information graphic can explain many different things once (novelty) or it can explain same things several times, by different means (redundancy). Striking a balance between novelty and redundancy critical. Novelty important avoid boring your readers, but a certain level redundancy necessary if you want be understood.See Figure 3.7, which shows a portion an infographic about giant waves that I’ll discuss later on in this book. The copy accompanying each step explanation repeats some information encoded in illustration. In this case, text not only complements image (or vice versa), it also strengthens message by clarifying what image shows. Another example: In a complex statistical chart, you could add necessary redundancy by highlighting relevant data points.Figure 3.7. Realistic illustrations accompanied by redundant copy.If I had visualize my Brazilian prisons infographic using visualization wheel, result would be Figure 3.8. I consider graphic more abstract than figurative, for an obvious reason: The charts don’t resemble physical reality but are conceptual tools that allow me encode quantitative data.Figure 3.8. Visualization wheel Brazilian prisons infographic.In a conventional sense, chart more functional than beautiful. It contains almost no decoration, although we paid attention color palettes and consistency typographical style.The chart multidimensional: It has at least five layers information that readers can explore.It’s not very original. All graphic forms are in common use—bar chart, slopegraph (used for second part), tables, and so on.The charts contain quite a bit redundancy. Notice on second page, where number inmates compared jail spaces, that same data encoded in different formats. It also includes explanatory text clarify most striking figures.Is this an adequate combination factors? I believe it is. Despite comments from my colleagues, I don’t think that this information graphic overloaded or excessively difficult read. It’s not prettiest thing in world, I concede. But it’s not very ugly, either. (I’ve done worse!)It true that, according my own terms, Brazilian prisons project leans toward upper half visualization wheel: It complex and deep. This should be no obstacle for readers a quality publication such as Época. If we assume that our audience willing read 8,000-word stories about convoluted corruption schemes in upper echelons government, why not apply same expectation graphics? It would be strange publish stories for adults illustrated with graphics for kids, which what happens when publications underestimate what  readers can absorb.Identifying your audienceThe complexity a graphic should be adapted nature your average reader. This sounds easier than it really is. Figure 3.9 explains that at least two factors influence communication between a designer and an audience through information graphics and visualizations: first, how well visual forms used encode information are adapted nature story graphic should tell; and second, previous knowledge user has about topic and about how those visual forms work (e.g., bar charts are more common than scatter-plots).Figure 3.9. Designers encode, users decode.The more specialized your audience niche, more you can take for granted, and more you can rely on what your users presumably already know.Consider charts in Figure 3.10. They display co-occurrence neuropsychiatric disorders within families, drawn from an academic paper published in online magazine PlosOne.1 Do you know what it all means? I don’t (well, actually, only a point). That not criticism charts: It’s just that researchers didn’t have me in mind when they plotted  graphics. They were thinking  peers, people with so much knowledge psychiatry and neuroscience that they can decode these graphics in blink an eye. They don’t need extra explainers, legends, or any other artifice that designers ordinarily employ make readers’ lives easier.1 B.C. Campbell and S.S. Wang, “Familial Linkage between Neuropsychiatric Disorders and Intellectual Interests,” PLoS ONE 7(1): e30405. Accessed Feb. 23, 2012 from http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0030405.Figure 3.10. Try figure out what these charts mean. It’s not easy, it?Few designers have privilege working for scientific publications, where it easy base decisions on assumptions about one’s audience. Most us work for general publications and face questions such as, “Is this graphic too complex for majority our readers?” or “Will our readers feel overwhelmed by amount data we’ve given them, or by way we’ve presented it?”Sadly, when faced with these challenges, too many communicators dumb down data, simplifying it rather than clarifying it, and they add cutesy illustrations and icons that,  way thinking, will make graphic presentations less dry.The mind-set behind this approach captured in a statement that I’ve heard, with minor variations, in three different newsrooms from three different managers who didn’t know one another: “Our readers are idiots.” The quote that opens this chapter, taken from E. B. White’s great classic on writing, The Elements Style, perfect antidote against this deleterious nihilism:No one can write decently who distrustful reader’s intelligence, or whose attitude patronizing.Do you respect your audience’s intelligence? How do you know if you are overestimating it (not likely) or underestimating it (most common)?Engineers vs. Designers: Edward Tufte and Nigel HolmesThere has always been a fundamental clash in information graphics and visualization between those who favor a rational, scientific approach profession, emphasizing functionality, and those who consider themselves “artists,” placing emphasis on emotion and aesthetics.There a middle ground between two groups, and boundary between two philosophies blurry. But, in general, it my perception that those in first group typically come from technical backgrounds (statistics, cartography, computer science, and engineering), while those in second group are graduates graphic design, art, and journalism programs. The first group would be drawn visualization wheels like one shown on left in Figure 3.11. The second group would prefer deliver graphics similar wheel on right.Figure 3.11. Different professional backgrounds, different ways facing projects.War between factions was more or less formally declared by Edward R. Tufte in 1990. A professor emeritus political science and statistics at Yale University, Tufte arguably most influential theoretician in information design and visualization, and deservedly so. His books The Visual Display Quantitative Information (1983), Envisioning Information (1990), Visual Explanations (1997), and Beautiful Evidence (2006) are must-reads in our field.In Envisioning Information, Tufte attacked an infographics tradition that took shape in United States in late 1980s and early 1990s. Thanks success visual style USA Today (launched in 1982) and Time magazine, illustrated charts and pictorial maps became very popular.Tufte coined a term define pictograms and illustrations within charts and maps: chartjunk. To make his case, he chose a Time chart (Figure 3.12) designed by renowned artist Nigel Holmes, magazine’s art director at time. Holmes himself recognizes that this not one his most inspired works, but also contends that Tufte picked just one graphic among hundreds and elevated an isolated anecdote a category level make his case.Figure 3.12. Chart by Nigel Holmes for Time magazine. (Reproduced with permission.)Tufte explained why he despised decorative ideology represented by graphic this way:Lurking behind chartjunk contempt both for information and for audience. Chartjunk promoters imagine that numbers and details are boring, dull, and tedious, requiring ornament enliven. Cosmetic decoration, which frequently distorts data, will never salvage an underlying lack content. If numbers are boring, then you’ve got wrong numbers (...) Worse contempt for our audience, designing as if readers were obtuse and uncaring. In fact, consumers graphics are often more intelligent about information at hand than those who fabricate data decoration (...) The operating moral premise information design should be that our readers are alert and caring; they may be busy, eager get on with it, but they are not stupid.22 Tufte, Envisioning Information, p. 34.Minimalism and EfficiencyA cherished notion Tufte’s a principle efficiency: A visual design project good if it communicates a lot with little. In his own words, in his principles graphic excellence:• Graphical excellence well-designed presentation interesting data—a matter substance, statistics, and design.• Graphical excellence consists complex ideas communicated with clarity, precision, and efficiency.• Graphical excellence that which gives viewer greatest number ideas in shortest time with least ink in smallest space.33 Tufte, The Visual Display Quantitative Information, p. 51.This efficiency principle defined with more precision by Tufte as data-ink ratio: a measurement amount ink that used represent data in a chart. Tufte defines data-ink elements as those that cannot be removed without destroying integrity presentation. The other items, those that amount decoration, can be eliminated because they are either redundant or they distract reader from what really matters. Tufte even proposed a little formula:Data-ink ratio = Ink that encodes data / Total amount ink used print graphicNigel Holmes’s diamonds graphic scores low in this formula. Let’s say that 1,000 drops color ink were used print it. Of those, around 150 are ones that define line, headline and subtitle, scale, and specific values. Those are elements that encode data. The woman illustration non-data ink. So:Data-ink ratio = 150 / 1,000 = 0.15According Tufte, closer data-ink ratio 1.0, better graphic is. The less ink you use for ornamental effects, better. Tufte doesn’t just consider mere decoration erasable. In his first book, he also proposed removing gridlines and even portions bars in a bar chart. See Figure 3.13.Figure 3.13. A traditional bar chart and its minimalist version.Tufte’s books imposed sanity at a time when flashy prevailed over functional, when pictorial and fun presided over abstract and intellectual. His writing style as austere and economical as graphics he favors, and many his best quotes and soundbites (including “chartjunk” and “chartoon”) became conceptual weapons in many discussions on what appropriate in information graphics and visualization. But are Tufte’s rants against redundant and unnecessary visual junk always right?Is All “Chartjunk” Junk?The problem with Tufte that he tends write in aphorisms and epigrams rather than building a continuous argument cover cover. John Grady, a Wheaton College professor, observed in 2006 that Tufte’s books are neither guides nor analytical texts, but “meditations” or essays: “Each chapter his books consists loosely integrated discussions merit particular displays.”4 That why so many readers Tufte’s work (in past, myself among them) feel a bit disoriented when they try transfer his abstract principles real world.4 Luc Pauwels, ed. Visual Cultures Science. (Hanover, NH: University Press New England, 2006), pp. 222-265.Another challenge Tufte’s writing that he doesn’t indicate whether an opinion based on research or derived from personal views. The writing matter-of-fact, as if ideas are self-evident and grounded in reason. There are no cracks in armor that would allow you sense whether author has any doubts. This minimalism not purely a rational choice, it also an aesthetic one. As much as I agree with Tufte on being serious about data you handle, respecting reader’s intelligence, and reducing clutter and increasing elegance, his lack differentiation between evidence-based assertions and personally informed intuitions a weakness.The data-ink ratio paradigmatic. His assertion that a higher efficiency—lowest amount visual resources communicate highest possible amount content—always facilitates understanding dubious. This doesn’t mean that designers should feel free start cramming charts with cartoons and illustrations, but it does mean that resources considered by Tufte be non-data ink—for instance, gridlines in a time-series chart, or unobtrusive and subtle icons that identify topic chart discusses—might not be junk at all. Far from obstacles understanding, they may enhance understanding.In past decade, academic papers have tested Tufte’s hypotheses with mixed results. A 2007 study from Ben-Gurion University presented 87 students with traditional bar charts and maximized data-ink ratio charts similar those in Figure 3.14. The minimalist version was rejected by many participants, perhaps because bar chart such a common graphical form. More importantly, when researchers tested see if readers interpreted minimalist chart better and faster than more cluttered one, they found no significant difference. In this case, radically reducing bar chart its main constituents was not a matter functionality, but visual style.55 Ohad Inbar, Noam Tractinsky, Joachim Meyer, “Minimalism in Information Visualization: Attitudes Towards Maximizing Data-Ink Ratio,” ECCE ’07: Proceedings 14th European Conference on Cognitive Ergonomics (New York: ACM, 2007).Figure 3.14. Which chart would you prefer?In another study at University Saskatchewan (Canada),6 20 students read four old Nigel Holmes graphics and  corresponding minimalist versions designed by researchers. One was our well-known diamonds chart in Figure 3.15.6 S. Bateman, R.L. Mandryk, C. Gutwin, A.M. Genest, D. McDine, C. Brooks. “Useful Junk? The Effects Visual Embellishment on Comprehension and Memorability Charts,” Proceedings 28th International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, (New York: ACM, 2010).Figure 3.15. The original graphic not very appealing, but stripped-down version was not easily remembered.The study was divided into three stages. First, researchers used eye-tracking devices register eye movements as each participant read each pair graphics.In second phase, each subject answered a questionnaire about charts’ contents, answering questions such as:1. What its central topic?2. What phenomena and variables does graphic show?3. What changes does graphic highlight in data it represents?4. Does graphic present information in an objective manner, or does author editorialize about content?As in Ben-Gurion University paper, researchers detected no significant differences in effectiveness embellished and minimalist graphics. The components each pair charts conveyed message equally well.The most interesting part study was third phase, in which researchers tested level short- and long-term recall for each graphic. The participants were divided into two groups equal size. They were not informed that they would be questioned about graphics later on. The first group was tested five minutes after phase two questioning was completed, while second group was asked return lab three weeks later.In all cases, participants were better able recall topics and contents chartjunk-filled graphics. Apparently,  coarse humor (“coarse” adjective Tufte used refer Holmes’s work) enhanced memory.Fun and FunctionalityTo call these two studies conclusive would be a mistake. Both have been justly criticized by experts such as Stephen Few, author two essential books on statistical charts,7 for  methodologies, for small number subjects tested, and for lack socioeconomic and cultural diversity among subjects. While it would be risky extract general lessons from papers, I personally believe they suggest compelling reasons doubt that always reducing charts  barest bones facilitates comprehension and memorability. It depends on audience’s nature, knowledge, tastes, and expectations.7 Stephen Few, “The Chartjunk Debate,” accessed Feb. 23, 2012 at http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/the_chartjunk_debate.pdf.This idea coincides with what other critics Tufte’s approach, including Nigel Holmes, have observed: Tufte’s influence in visualization and information graphics communities has led many publications adopt a style that serious, cold, and stripped bare aesthetic attributes that may be gratuitous statistician but that are useful for readers. This not say that we should not strive for economy style and respect integrity data, but that, as Donald A. Norman pointed out in Emotional Design (2003), beautiful things are more functional, and beauty as much in eye designer as it in eye beholder. Feeling good about an artifact makes us better at using it accomplish a goal.Holmes anticipated a similar idea in his early writings. He has always been an advocate humanizing information graphics and using humor instill affection in readers for numbers and charts. In Designer’s Guide Creating Charts and Diagrams (1984), he wrote in what appears be a direct reference Tufte’s Visual Display Quantitative Information, published year before:If you belong school people who believe that charts should only present statistics in most straightforward, plain way, with no other visual help reader, for example, than bar bar chart, line fever graph, circle pie chart, or rules table, then move on another part book. As long as artist understands that primary function convey statistics and respects that duty, then you can have fun (or be serious) with image; that is, form in which those statistics appear.88 Nigel Holmes, Designer’s Guide Creating Charts & Diagrams (New York: Watson-Guptill Publications, 1984), pp. 72-76.Holmes also referenced this passage from A Primer Visual Literacy (1973), a classic book by Donis A. Dondis:Boredom as much a threat in visual design as it elsewhere in art and communication. The mind and eye demand stimulation and surprise.And Holmes praised power humor:Humor a great weapon in your visual arsenal. As long as it not malicious, making people laugh with you will usually help them remember your image and therefore point chart. Even a smile will encourage a reader look into statistics if he or she might not have thought reading in a less-embellished chart.Many examples Holmes includes in his book are problematic from a structural standpoint because, as in Figure 3.16, integrating lines and bars with illustrations sometimes leads misleading distortions. But they do use humor, and they are memorable. Most graphics would not be publishable today, as Holmes himself acknowledges, but we must remember that Designer’s Guide Creating Charts and Diagrams was marketed almost 30 years ago and a product its times.Figure 3.16. Too much expense on medical care makes bars feel sick. Chart by Nigel Holmes for Time magazine, 1979.Holmes’s style has evolved. Without losing its humorous appeal, it has become more restrained, as evident in his wonderfully illustrated Wordless Diagrams (2004), which witty, funny, and informative. (See Figure 3.17.) His work has become closer man he calls his main inspiration, Otto Neurath, one great thinkers twentieth century.Figure 3.17. My mother was very happy after I read Wordless Diagrams (2005) by Nigel Holmes. After more than 30 years, I finally learned how properly fold a T-shirt.Otto Neurath and Visual Education MassesOtto Neurath was an Austrian philosopher, mathematician, sociologist, and political scientist born in 1882. He forged his fame in world information graphics in Vienna first quarter twentieth century.At time, capital city Austria was a scientific and philosophical powerhouse. Besides Neurath, geniuses like Karl Popper, Niels Böhr, and Kurt Gödel walked Vienna’s streets. Together, these intellectuals would be known as The Circle Vienna, and  ideas gave rise philosophical tradition logical empiricism.Neurath combined virtues a rigorous, rational, and logical mind with humanitarian concerns that emerged from his leftist leaning. He was a democratic socialist, a rare species in a time ideological extremes. Neurath didn’t want communicate solely with his peers. He wanted promote mass education. He defended idea that abstract and mathematical thought could be conveyed with clarity and ease people regardless  social, cultural, and economic backgrounds.Around 1925, as director Museum Society and Economy in Vienna, Neurath devised Isotype (International System Typographic Picture Education), a universal language based on pictograms whose goal was “humanization knowledge” and overcoming cultural barriers. Over many years, he worked with Gerd Arntz, a German graphic designer, and Marie Reidemeister (who would become Mrs. Neurath in 1940s) create many displays information, charts, and maps beautiful simplicity and clarity. See Figure 3.18 representing amount fabric produced in Britain between 1820 and 1880. The chart shows a paradigm change: At beginning century, production was small and mainly a family venture; later, it became industrialized.Figure 3.18. Otto & Marie Neurath Isotype Collection, University Reading.In his professional autobiography, written between 1943 and 1945 and titled From Hieroglyphics Isotype (2010 edition), Neurath explained what his pictographic language was intended achieve:We started our visualization in adult education by making exhibitions for museums and preparing sheets for classes and diagrammatic films in Isotype style. We tried evolve a new type exhibition attract masses immediately. The subject exhibition should be serious but it should be combined with a charm and direct appeal everybody. As many people should be persuaded visit it as would go some public show purely entertainment value. Education has compete with entertainment (...) It would be dangerous if education were become a purely occupational matter and something boring in itself.99 Otto Neurath, From Hieroglyphics Isotype, p. 113.Charm and direct appeal. Those words resonate deeply in Nigel Holmes’s work, which, like Neurath’s, tends be tightly edited and convey a few ideas with clarity and power. That goal not opposite Tufte’s approach, but it different. Tufte favors highly detailed, multivariate presentations that allow careful exploration on part reader.So who right—Tufte in his defense dense graphics, bereft trivial “junk”? Or Holmes and Neurath and  populist graphics, encoding just a few easily digestible messages with friendly looking pictograms and humorous illustrations? Is it possible reach a synthesis between two approaches, or at least choose one them without despising other? I believe it is. After all, even if it may seem otherwise, Tufte’s and Holmes’s ideologies are more similar than different. This focus next chapter.
